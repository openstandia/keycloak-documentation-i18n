"There are multiple ways you can logout from a web application.  For Java EE "
"servlet containers, you can call `HttpServletRequest.logout()`. For any "
"other browser application, you can point the browser at any url of your web "
"application that has a security constraint and pass in a query parameter "
"GLO, i.e. `$$http://myapp?GLO=true$$`.  This will log you out if you have an "
"SSO session with your browser."

"Internally, the SAML adapter stores a mapping between the SAML session "

"be maintained in JBoss application server family (WildFly 10/11, EAP 6/7) "
"across cluster for distributable applications. As a precondition, the HTTP "
"sessions need to be distributed across cluster (i.e. application is marked "
"with `<distributable/>` tag in application's `web.xml`)."
