"It's generally not needed to use JAAS for most of the applications, "
"especially if they are HTTP based, and you should most likely choose one of "
"our other adapters.  However, some applications and systems may still rely "
"on pure legacy JAAS solution.  {project_name} provides two login modules to "
"help in these situations."

"This login module allows to authenticate with username/password from "
"{project_name}.  It's using <<_resource_owner_password_credentials_flow,"
"Resource Owner Password Credentials>> flow to validate if the provided "
"username/password is valid. It's useful for non-web based systems, which "
"need to rely on JAAS and want to use {project_name}, but can't use the "
"standard browser based flows due to their non-web nature. Example of such "
"application could be messaging or SSH."
