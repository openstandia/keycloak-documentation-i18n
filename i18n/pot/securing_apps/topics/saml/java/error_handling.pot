"{project_name} has some error handling facilities for servlet based client "
"adapters.  When an error is encountered in authentication, the client "
"adapter will call `HttpServletResponse.sendError()`.  You can set up an "
"`error-page` within your `web.xml` file to handle the error however you "
"want.  The client adapter can throw 400, 401, 403, and 500 errors."

"The client adapter also sets an `HttpServletRequest` attribute that you can "
"retrieve.  The attribute name is `org.keycloak.adapters.spi."
"AuthenticationError`.  Typecast this object to: `org.keycloak.adapters.saml."
"SamlAuthenticationError`.  This class can tell you exactly what happened.  "
"If this attribute is not set, then the adapter was not responsible for the "
"error code."
