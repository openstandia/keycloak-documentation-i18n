msgstr ""

msgid "This guide describes how to upgrade {project_name}. It is recommended that you start by upgrading the {project_name} server first and {project_name} adapters second."

msgid "In a minor upgrade of {project_name}, all user sessions are lost. After the upgrade, all users will have to log in again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Procedure"
msgstr ""

msgid "Back up the old installation (configuration, themes, and so on)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Back up the database using instructions in the documentation for your relational database."
msgstr ""

msgid "Upgrade the {project_name} server."

msgid "If you need to revert the upgrade, first restore the old installation, and then restore the database from the backup copy."
msgstr ""

msgid "Upgrade the adapters."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is important that you upgrade {project_name} server before upgrading the adapters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Prerequisites"
msgstr ""

msgid "Handle any open transactions and delete the data/tx-object-store/ transaction directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Download the new server archive"

msgid "When you start the server with this setting your database is automatically migrated if the database schema has changed in the new version."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating an index on huge tables with millions of records can easily take a huge amount of time and potentially cause major service disruption on upgrades. For those cases, we added a threshold (the number of records) for automated index creation. By default, this threshold is `300000` records. When the number of records is higher than the threshold, the index is not created automatically, and there will be a warning message in server logs including SQL commands which can be applied later manually."
msgstr ""

msgid "To change the threshold, set the `index-creation-threshold` property, value for the default `connections-liquibase` provider:"

msgstr ""

msgid "In summary:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you have customized any of the changed templates listed below you need to compare the template from the base theme to see if there are changes you need to apply."

Most likely you will need to apply the same changes to your customized templates. If you have not customized any of the listed templates you can skip this section."
msgstr ""

msgid "A best practice is to use a diff tool to compare the templates to see what changes you might need to make to your customized template. If you have only made minor changes it is simpler to compare the updated template to your customized template.

msgstr ""

msgid "If you are inheriting styles from the keycloak or rh-sso themes you might need to update your custom styles to reflect changes made to the styles from the built-in themes."

msgstr ""

msgid "Compatibility with older adapters"
msgstr ""

msgid "As mentioned above, we try to support newer release versions of {project_name} server working with older release versions of the adapters. However, in some cases we need to include fixes on the {project_name} server side which may break compatibility with older versions of the adapters. For example, when we implement new aspects of the OpenID Connect specification, which older client adapter versions were not aware of."
msgstr ""

msgid "In those cases, we added Compatibility modes. For OpenId Connect clients, there is a section named `OpenID Connect Compatibility Modes` in the {project_name} admin console, on the page with client details. Here, you can disable some new aspects of the {project_name} server to preserve compatibility with older client adapters. More details are available in the tool tips of individual switches."

As a result, the database check is not shown in the `checks:` array anymore when calling `/health/live`, so when there is a database hiccup, the liveness probe will still return HTTP status-code 200 and a status of UP, so no pod restart may be triggered."
msgstr ""

msgid "The `health/ready` endpoint used for readiness probes still checks for a working database connection.

msgstr ""

msgid "{project_name} has several limitations; for example, downtime is needed for upgrading a {project_name} cluster. To address the limitations, an in-depth refactor has been initiated."
msgstr ""

msgid "The changes in this version are mostly attached to storage refactoring and a preparation of a new storage, called map storage. This storage will eventually replace the current storage, which will be called a _legacy store_ with this version. The legacy store will still be available in {project_name} for several more versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "The new store imposes a strict separation of responsibility between the service and storage layers. For that reason, the service layer's visibility of an object's origin will be restricted, so it will not be able to discriminate between cached or non-cached objects, or objects originating from local or federated storage."
msgstr ""

msgid "User storage SPI will become deprecated. It will be supported for several more versions, but will be eventually replaced by the Map Storage SPI, which will offer the ability to create custom storages for any recognized area, such as users, roles, clients, or groups."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extensions that rely on the level of detail available to services in the legacy store will need adjustment to retain this ability for the full deprecation period of the legacy store. The following section describes how that adjustment is accomplished."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using a legacy and map store is mutually exclusive; one store cannot be used while the other is active."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changes in the module structure"
msgstr ""

msgid "As part of introducing the new storage functionality, several public APIs around storage functionality in `KeycloakSession` have been consolidated, and some have been deprecated and will be removed in one of the next versions. Three new modules have been introduced, and data-oriented code from `server-spi`, `server-spi-private`, and `services` modules have been moved there:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`org.keycloak:keycloak-model-legacy`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Contains all public facing APIs from the legacy store, such as the User Storage API."
msgstr ""

msgid "`org.keycloak:keycloak-model-legacy-private`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Contains private implementations that relate to user storage management, such as storage `*Manager` classes."
msgstr ""

msgid "`org.keycloak:keycloak-model-legacy-services`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Contains all REST endpoints that directly operate on the legacy store, and have no meaning in the new store."
msgstr ""

msgid "These modules will be available as long as legacy stores will be supported. After that period, they will be removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "This change impacts deployments of existing user storage providers in the Wildfly distribution. If your user storage provider is deployed as a WAR archive, you need to add the `META-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file into that archive stating the modified dependencies as shown below:"

msgid "`KeycloakSession` has been simplified. Several methods have been deprecated in `KeycloakSession` and will be removed in a future version."
msgstr ""

msgid "`KeycloakSession` session contains several methods for obtaining a provider for a particular object type, such as for a `UserProvider` there are `users()`, `userLocalStorage()`, `userCache()`, `userStorageManager()`, and `userFederatedStorage()`. This situation may be confusing for the developer who has to understand the exact meaning of each method, and depends on current store layout. The new store does not distinguish federated from local storage."
msgstr ""

msgid "For those reasons, only the `users()` method will be kept in `KeycloakSession`, and should replace all other calls listed above. The rest of the methods are deprecated, and will eventually be removed. The same pattern of deprecation applies to methods of other object areas, such as `clients()` or `groups()`. All methods ending in `++*StorageManager()++` and `++*LocalStorage++()` now throw an exception when being called, as there is no direct replacement in the new store. The next section describes how to migrate those calls to the new API or use the legacy API while using the old store."
msgstr ""

msgid "The deprecated methods in KeycloakSession will be removed in a future release. The `keycloak-model-legacy-*` modules will be available for a longer time and will eventually be removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Migrating existing providers that do not depend on the legacy store"
msgstr ""

msgid "The existing providers need no migration if they do not call a deprecated method, which should be the case for most providers."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the provider uses deprecated methods, but does not rely on local versus non-local storage, changing a call from the now deprecated `userLocalStorage()` to the method `users()` is the best option.

Now we changed the server part too and ID token will be sent to the application just if `scope=openid` is really used. If it's not used, then ID token will be skipped and just Access token and Refresh token will be sent to the application.

msgstr ""

msgid "For the offline tokens without KID, {project_name} 2.5.1 will always use the active realm key to find the proper key for the token verification. In other words, migration of old offline tokens will work. So for example, your user requested offline token in 1.9.8, then you migrate from 1.9.8 to 2.5.1 and then your user will be still able to refresh his old offline token in 2.5.1 version."
msgstr ""

msgid "But a limitation exists. Once you change the realm active key, the users won't be able to refresh old offline tokens anymore. So you shouldn't change the active realm key until all your users with offline tokens refreshed their tokens. Obviously newly refreshed tokens will have KID in the header, so after all users exchange their old offline tokens, you are free to change the active realm key."

We added `First Broker Login` flow in this release and the method `IdentityProviderMapper.importNewUser` is now called after `First Broker Login` flow is finished. So if you want to have any attribute available in `Review Profile` page, you would need to use the method `preprocessFederatedIdentity` instead of `importNewUser` . You can set any attribute by invoke `BrokeredIdentityContext.setUserAttribute` and that will be available on `Review profile` page."

Option is under token settings in admin console. When a refresh token is used to obtain a new access token a new refresh token is also included. When option is enabled, then this new refresh token should be used next time the access token is refreshed. It won't be possible to reuse old refresh token multiple times."

msgid "Some packages renamed"

msgid "We did a bit of restructure and renamed some packages. It is mainly about renaming internal packages of util classes. The most important classes used in your application ( for example AccessToken or KeycloakSecurityContext ) as well as the SPI are still unchanged. However, a slight chance exists that you will be affected and will need to update imports of your classes. For example if you are using multitenancy and KeycloakConfigResolver, you will be affected as for example class HttpFacade was moved to different package - it is `org.keycloak.adapters.spi.HttpFacade` now."

This change was done to make it easier to have groups of the different types for the same theme into one folder."

We did migration scripts for both RDBMS and Mongo, which should ensure that claims configured for particular application/client will be converted into corresponding protocol mappers (Still it's safer to back up DB before migrating to newer version though). Same applies for exported JSON representation from previous version."
