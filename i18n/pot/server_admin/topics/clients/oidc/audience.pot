"The typical environment where the {project_name} is deployed generally "

"There are also _services_ (called _Resource Servers_ in the OAuth 2 "
"specification), which serve requests from frontend client applications and "
"provide resources. These services typically require an _Access token_ "
"(Bearer token) to be sent to them to authenticate for a particular request. "
"This token was previously obtained by the frontend application when it tries "
"to log in against {project_name}."

"In the environment where the trust among services is low, you may encounter "
"this scenario:"

#. type: Plain text

"A frontend client called `my-app` is required to be authenticated against "
"{project_name}."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"A user is authenticated in {project_name}. {project_name} then issued tokens "
"to the `my-app` application."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The application `my-app` used the token to invoke the service `evil-"
"service`. The application needs to invoke `evil-service` as the service is "
"able to serve some very useful data."

#. type: Plain text

"The `evil-service` application returned the response to `my-app`. However, "
"at the same time, it kept the token previously sent to it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The `evil-service` application then invoked another service called `good-"
"service` with the previously kept token. The invocation was successful and "
"`good-service` returned the data. This results in broken security as the "
"`evil-service` misused the token to access other services on behalf of the "
"client `my-app`."

"In some environments, this example work flow may be even requested behavior as the `evil-service` may need to retrieve\n"
"      additional data from `good-service` to be able to properly return the requested data to the original caller (my-app client).\n"
"      You may notice similarities with the Kerberos Credential Delegation. As with the Kerberos Credential Delegation, an unlimited\n"
"      audience is a mixed blessing as it is only useful when a high level of trust exists among services. Otherwise, it is\n"
"      recommended to limit audience as described next. You can limit audience and at the same time allow the `evil-service` to\n"
"      retrieve required data from the `good-service`. In this case, you need to ensure that both the `evil-service` and `good-service`\n"
"      are added as audiences to the token.\n"

#. type: Plain text

"To prevent any misuse of the access token as in the example above, it is "

"A user is authenticated in {project_name}. {project_name} then issued tokens "

"in the authentication request sent to the {project_name} server. See "
"<<_client_scopes, Client Scopes section>> for more details about the _scope_ "
"parameter.  The token issued to the `my-app` client contains the audience, "

"The frontend client itself is not automatically added to the access token "

"example some URL, if you want different audience than client ID."
