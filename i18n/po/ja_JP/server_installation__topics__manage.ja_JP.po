If you run `jboss-cli` on the same machine as your running standalone server or domain controller and your account has appropriate file permissions, you do not have to setup or enter in a admin username and password.  See the link:{appserver_admindoc_link}[_{appserver_admindoc_name}_] for more details on how to make things more secure if you are uncomfortable with that setup."

You'll be shown how to edit the _standalone.xml_ or _domain.xml_ directly.  This must be done when the server (or servers) are offline.  Additionally, you may be shown how to apply config changes on a running server using the app server's command line interface ({appserver_name} CLI).  This chapter discusses how you will do this."
