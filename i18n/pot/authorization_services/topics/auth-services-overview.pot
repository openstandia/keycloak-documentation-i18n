"{project_name} is based on a set of administrative UIs and a RESTful API, "
"and provides the necessary means to create permissions for your protected "
"resources and scopes, associate those permissions with authorization "
"policies, and enforce authorization decisions in your applications and "
"services."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Resource servers (applications or services serving protected resources) "
"usually rely on some kind of information to decide if access should be "
"granted to a protected resource. For RESTful-based resource servers, that "
"information is usually obtained from a security token, usually sent as a "
"bearer token on every request to the server. For web applications that rely "
"on a session to authenticate users, that information is usually stored in a "
"user's session and retrieved from there for each request."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Frequently, resource servers only perform authorization decisions based on "
"role-based access control (RBAC), where the roles granted to the user trying "
"to access protected resources are checked against the roles mapped to these "
"same resources. While roles are very useful and used by applications, they "
"also have a few limitations:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Resources and roles are tightly coupled and changes to roles (such as "
"adding, removing, or changing an access context) can impact multiple "
"resources"

"Changes to your security requirements can imply deep changes to application "
"code to reflect these changes"

"Depending on your application size, role management might become difficult "
"and error-prone"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"It is not the most flexible access control mechanism. Roles do not represent "
"who you are and lack contextual information. If you have been granted a "
"role, you have at least some access."

"Considering that today we need to consider heterogeneous environments where "
"users are distributed across different regions, with different local "
