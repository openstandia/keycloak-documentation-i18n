msgid "The user storage providers can be packaged within any Java EE component if you set up the `META-INF/services` file correctly to point to your providers. For example, if your provider needs to use third-party libraries, you can package up your provider within an EAR and store these third-party libraries in the `lib/` directory of the EAR.  Also note that provider JARs can make use of the `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file that EJBs, WARS, and EARs can use in a JBoss/Wildfly environment. For more details on this file, see the JBoss/Wildfly documentation. It allows you to pull in external dependencies among other fine-grained actions."
