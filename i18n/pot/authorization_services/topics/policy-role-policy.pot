"By default, roles added to this policy are not specified as required and the "
"policy will grant access if the user requesting access has been granted any "
"of these roles. However, you can specify a specific role as "
"<<_policy_rbac_required, required>> if you want to enforce a specific role. "
"You can also combine required and non-required roles, regardless of whether "

"Role policies can be useful when you need more restricted role-based access "
"control (RBAC), where specific roles must be enforced to grant access to an "
"object. For instance, you can enforce that a user must consent to allowing a "
"client application (which is acting on the user's behalf) to access the "
"user's resources. You can use {project_name} Client Scope Mapping to enable "
"consent pages or even enforce clients to explicitly provide a scope when "
"obtaining access tokens from a {project_name} server."
