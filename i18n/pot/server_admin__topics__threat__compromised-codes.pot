"For the <<_oidc-auth-flows, OIDC Auth Code Flow>>, it would be very hard for "
"an attacker to compromise {project_name} authorization codes.  "
"{project_name} generates a cryptographically strong random value for its "
"authorization codes so it would be very hard to guess an access token.  An "
"authorization code can only be used once to obtain an access token.  In the "
"admin console you can specify how long an authorization code is valid for on "
"the <<_timeouts, timeouts page>>.  This value should be really short, as "
"short as a few seconds and just long enough for the client to make the "
"request to obtain a token from the code."
