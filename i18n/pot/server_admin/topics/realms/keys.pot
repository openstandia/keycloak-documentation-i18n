"The authentication protocols that are used by {project_name} require "

"{project_name} has a single active keypair at a time, but can have several "
"passive keys as well. The active keypair is used to create new signatures, "
"while the passive keypairs can be used to verify previous signatures. This "
"makes it possible to regularly rotate the keys without any downtime or "
"interruption to users."

"To view the active keys for a realm select the realm in the admin console "
"click on `Realm settings` then `Keys`. This will show the currently active "
"keys for the realm. {project_name} currently only supports RSA signatures so "

msgid "Rotating keys"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"It's recommended to regularly rotate keys. To do so you should start by "
"creating new keys with a higher priority than the existing active keys. Or "
"create new keys with the same priority and making the previous keys passive."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Once new keys are available all new tokens and cookies will be signed with "
"the new keys. When a user authenticates to an application the SSO cookie is "
"updated with the new signature. When OpenID Connect tokens are refreshed new "
"tokens are signed with the new keys. This means that over time all cookies "
"and tokens will use the new keys and after a while the old keys can be "
"removed."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"How long you wait to delete old keys is a tradeoff between security and "
"making sure all cookies and tokens are updated.  In general it should be "
"acceptable to drop old keys after a few weeks. Users that have not been "
"active in the period between the new keys where added and the old keys "
"removed will have to re-authenticate."

"This also applies to offline tokens. To make sure they are updated the "

"{project_name} has the signing keys stored just locally and they are never "

"the compromised key, but also the client application will be forced to "
"download new keypair from the {project_name}, hence the tokens signed by the "
"compromised key won't be valid anymore. Note that your REST and confidential "
