"If a request is sent *without* a previously issued RPT, only ```limit``` "

"permissions from a previously issued RPT, the server will include the first "
"permissions defined there."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"This option allows clients to control the size of RPTs and keep only last "

"client is capable of sending previously issued RPTs while asking for new "
"permissions (a.k.a.: incremental authorization)."
