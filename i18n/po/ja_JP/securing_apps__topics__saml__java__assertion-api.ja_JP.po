msgid "After a successful SAML login, your application code may want to obtain attribute values passed with the SAML assertion.  `HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal()` returns a `Principal` object that you can typecast into a {project_name} specific class called `org.keycloak.adapters.saml.SamlPrincipal`.  This object allows you to look at the raw assertion and also has convenience functions to look up attribute values."
