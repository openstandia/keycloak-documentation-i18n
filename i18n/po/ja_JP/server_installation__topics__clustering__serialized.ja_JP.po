msgid "By default, the maximum timeout for this lock is 900 seconds.  If a node is waiting on this lock for more than the timeout it will fail to boot.  Typically you won't need to increase/decrease the default value, but just in case it's possible to configure it in `standalone.xml`, `standalone-ha.xml`, or `domain.xml` file in your distribution.  The location of this file depends on your <<_operating-mode, operating mode>>."
