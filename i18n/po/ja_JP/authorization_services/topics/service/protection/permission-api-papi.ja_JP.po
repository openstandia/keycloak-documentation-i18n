"In the full UMA protocol, resource servers can register permission requests in the server to support authorization flows where a resource owner (the user that owns a resource being requested) can approve access to his resources by third parties, among other ways. This represents one of the main features of the UMA specification: resource owners can control their own resources and the policies that govern them. Currently {project_name} UMA implementation support is very limited in this regard. For example, the system does not store permission tickets on the server and we are essentially using UMA to provide API security and base our authorization offerings. In the future, full support of UMA and other use cases is planned.\n"
