"The purpose of this guide is to walk through the steps that need to be completed prior to booting up the\n"
"{project_name} server for the first time.  If you just want to test drive {project_name}, it pretty much runs out of the box with its\n"
"own embedded and local-only database.  For\n"
" actual deployments that are going to be run in production you'll need to decide how you want to manage server configuration\n"
" at runtime (standalone or domain mode), configure a shared database for {project_name} storage, set up encryption and HTTPS,\n"
" and finally set up {project_name} to run in a cluster.  This guide walks through each and every aspect of any pre-boot\n"
" decisions and setup you must do prior to deploying the server.\n"

msgid "One thing to particularly note is that {project_name} is derived from the {appserver_name} Application Server.  Many aspects of configuring {project_name} revolve around {appserver_name} configuration elements.  Often this guide will direct you to documentation outside of the manual if you want to dive into more detail."
