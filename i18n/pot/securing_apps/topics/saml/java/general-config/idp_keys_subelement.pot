msgid "IDP Keys sub element"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The Keys sub element of IDP is only used to define the certificate or public "
"key to use to verify documents signed by the IDP.  It is defined in the same "
"way as the <<_saml-sp-keys,SP's Keys element>>.  But again, you only have to "
"define one certificate or public key reference. Note that, if both IDP and "
"SP are realized by {project_name} server and adapter, respectively, there is "
"no need to specify the keys for signature validation, see below."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"It is possible to configure SP to obtain public keys for IDP signature "
"validation from published certificates automatically, provided both SP and "
"IDP are implemented by {project_name}.  This is done by removing all "
"declarations of signature validation keys in Keys sub element. If the Keys "
"sub element would then remain empty, it can be omitted completely. The keys "
"are then automatically obtained by SP from SAML descriptor, location of "
"which is derived from SAML endpoint URL specified in the <<_sp-idp-"
"singlesignonservice,IDP SingleSignOnService sub element>>.  Settings of the "
"HTTP client that is used for SAML descriptor retrieval usually needs no "
"additional configuration, however it can be configured in the <<_sp-idp-"
"httpclient,IDP HttpClient sub element>>."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"It is also possible to specify multiple keys for signature verification. "
"This is done by declaring multiple Key elements within Keys sub element that "
"have `signing` attribute set to `true`.  This is useful for example in "
"situation when the IDP signing keys are rotated: There is usually a "
"transition period when new SAML protocol messages and assertions are signed "
"with the new key but those signed by previous key should still be accepted."

"It is not possible to configure {project_name} to both obtain the keys for "
"signature verification automatically and define additional static signature "
"verification keys."
