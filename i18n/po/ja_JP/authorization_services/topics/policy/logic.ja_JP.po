"For example, suppose you want to create a policy where only users *not* "
"granted with a specific role should be given access. In this case, you can "
"create a role-based policy using that role and set its *Logic* field to "
"*Negative*. If you keep *Positive*, which is the default behavior, the "
"policy result will be kept as it is."
