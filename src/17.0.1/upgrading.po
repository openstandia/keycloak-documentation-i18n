msgid "Preparing for upgrading"

msgid "Before you upgrade, be aware of the order in which you need to perform the upgrade steps. Also note potential issues that can occur within the upgrade process. In general, you must upgrade {project_name} server first, and then upgrade the adapters."

msgid "In a minor upgrade of {project_name}, all user sessions are lost. After the upgrade, all users will have to log in again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Prerequisites"
msgstr ""

msgid "Prior to applying the upgrade, handle any open transactions and delete the data/tx-object-store/ transaction directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Procedure"
msgstr ""

msgid "Back up the old installation (configuration, themes, and so on)."

msgid "Back up the database. For detailed information on how to back up the database, see the documentation for the relational database you are using."

msgstr ""

msgid "Creating an index on huge tables with millions of records can easily take a huge amount of time and potentially cause major service disruption on upgrades. For those cases, we added a threshold (the number of records) for automated index creation. By default, this threshold is `300000` records. When the number of records is higher than the threshold, the index is not created automatically, and there will be a warning message in server logs including SQL commands which can be applied later manually."

Most likely you will need to apply the same changes to your customized templates. If you have not customized any of the listed templates you can skip this section."
msgstr ""

msgid "A best practice is to use a diff tool to compare the templates to see what changes you might need to make to your customized template. If you have only made minor changes it is simpler to compare the updated template to your customized template.

msgstr ""

msgid "If you are inheriting styles from the keycloak or rh-sso themes you might need to update your custom styles to reflect changes made to the styles from the built-in themes."
msgstr ""

msgid "A best practice is to use a diff tool to compare the changes to stylesheets between the old server installation and the new server installation."

msgid ""
"$ diff {project_dirref}_OLD/themes/keycloak/login/resources/css/login.css \\\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "Compatibility with older adapters"
msgstr ""

msgid "As mentioned above, we try to support newer release versions of {project_name} server working with older release versions of the adapters. However, in some cases we need to include fixes on the {project_name} server side which may break compatibility with older versions of the adapters. For example, when we implement new aspects of the OpenID Connect specification, which older client adapter versions were not aware of."
msgstr ""

msgid "In those cases, we added Compatibility modes. For OpenId Connect clients, there is a section named `OpenID Connect Compatibility Modes` in the {project_name} admin console, on the page with client details. Here, you can disable some new aspects of the {project_name} server to preserve compatibility with older client adapters. More details are available in the tool tips of individual switches."

Earlier versions of the admin-client might work with later versions of {project_name} server, but earlier versions of {project_name} server might not work with later versions of the admin-client.

Otherwise, they will not be read from the database anymore and possibly deleted. This situation implies that the `username` can now also be accessed and set via `UserModel.getFirstAttribute(UserModel.USERNAME)`. Similar implications exist for other fields. Implementors of SPIs subclassing the `UserModel` directly or indirectly should ensure that the behavior between `setUsername` and `setSingleAttribute(UserModel.USERNAME, ...)` (and similar for the other fields) is consistent.

msgid "If you migrate from version 2.2.0 or older and you used offline tokens, then your offline tokens didn't have KID in the token header.

msgid "For the offline tokens without KID, {project_name} 2.5.1 will always use the active realm key to find the proper key for the token verification. In other words, migration of old offline tokens will work.
