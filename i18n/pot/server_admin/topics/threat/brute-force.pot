"A brute force attack happens when an attacker is trying to guess a user's "
"password.  {project_name} has some limited brute force detection "
"capabilities.  If turned on, a user account will be temporarily disabled if "
"a threshold of login failures is reached.  To enable this feature go to the "
"`Realm Settings` left menu item, click on the `Security Defenses` tab, then "
"additional go to the `Brute Force Detection` sub-tab."

"There are 2 different configurations for brute force detection; permanent "
"lockout and temporary lockout. Permanent lockout will disable a user's "
"account after an attack is detected; the account will be disabled until an "
"administrator renables it. Temporary lockout will disable a user's account "
"for a time period after an attack is detected; the time period for which the "
"account is disabled increases the longer the attack continues."
