"An _authentication flow_ is a container for all authentications, screens, "
"and actions that must happen during login, registration, and other "
"{project_name} workflows.  If you go to the admin console `Authentication` "
"left menu item and go to the `Flows` tab, you can view all the defined flows "
"in the system and what actions and checks each flow requires.  This section "
"does a walk through of the browser login flow.  In the left drop down list "
"select `browser` to come to the screen shown below:"

"The `Auth Type` column is the name of authentication or action that will be "
"executed.  If an authentication is indented this means it is in a sub-flow "
"and may or may not be executed depending on the behavior of its parent.  The "
"`Requirement` column is a set of radio buttons which define whether or not "
"the action will execute.  Let's describe what each radio button means:"
