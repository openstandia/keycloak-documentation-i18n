"Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) 7.1 is based on the Keycloak project and "
"provides security for your web applications by providing Web single sign-on "
"capabilities based on popular standards such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, "
"and OAuth 2.0.  The Red Hat Single Sign-On Server can act as a SAML or "
"OpenID Connect&#8211;based identity provider, mediating with your enterprise "
"user directory or third-party SSO provider for identity information and your "
"applications using standards-based tokens."

"RH-SSO provides two operating modes: standalone server or managed domain. "
"The standalone server operating mode represents running RH-SSO as a single "
"server instance. The managed domain operating mode allows for the management "
"of multiple RH-SSO instances from a single control point. The upgrade "
"process differs depending on which operating mode has been implemented. "
"Specific instructions for each mode are provided where applicable."

"A major upgrade or migration is required when RH-SSO is upgraded from one "

"Red Hat Single Sign-On 8.0. There may be breaking API changes between major "

"code changes should not be required for applications or custom server "

"Red Hat Single Sign-On 7 also periodically provides micro releases that "

"version by the last digit, for example from 7.1.0 to 7.1.1. These release do "
"not require migration and should not impact the server configuration files. "
"The patch management system for ZIP installations can also rollback the "

"A micro release only contains the artifacts that have changed. For example "

"JavaScript adapter, but not the EAP adapter, only the server and JavaScript "
"adapter are released and require updating."
