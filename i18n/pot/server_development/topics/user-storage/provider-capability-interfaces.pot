"If you have examined the `UserStorageProvider` interface closely you might "
"notice that it does not define any methods for locating or managing users. "
"These methods are actually defined in other _capability interfaces_ "
"depending on what scope of capabilities your external user store can provide "
"and execute on. For example, some external stores are read-only and can only "
"do simple queries and credential validation. You will only be required to "
"implement the _capability interfaces_ for the features you are able to. You "
"can implement these interfaces:"
