"By default {project_name} binds to the localhost loopback address "
"`127.0.0.1`.  That's not a very useful default if you want the "
"authentication server available on your network.  Generally, what we "
"recommend is that you deploy a reverse proxy or load balancer on a public "
"network and route traffic to individual {project_name} server instances on a "
"private network.  In either case though, you still need to set up your "
"network interfaces to bind to something other than `localhost`."

"on your <<_operating-mode, operating mode>>) and look for the `interfaces` "

"The `public` interface corresponds to subsystems creating sockets that are "
"available publicly.  An example of one of these subsystems is the web layer "
"which serves up the authentication endpoints of {project_name}.  The "
"`management` interface corresponds to sockets opened up by the management "
