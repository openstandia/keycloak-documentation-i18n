"The user storage providers can be packaged within any Java EE component if "
"you set up the `META-INF/services` file correctly to point to your "
"providers. For example, if your provider needs to use third-party libraries, "
"you can package up your provider within an EAR and store these third-party "
"libraries in the `lib/` directory of the EAR.  Also note that provider JARs "
"can make use of the `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file that EJBs, WARS, "
"and EARs can use in a JBoss/Wildfly environment. For more details on this "
"file, see the JBoss/Wildfly documentation. It allows you to pull in external "
"dependencies among other fine-grained actions."
