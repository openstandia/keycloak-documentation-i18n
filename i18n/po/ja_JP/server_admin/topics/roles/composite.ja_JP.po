msgid "Any realm or client level role can be turned into a _composite role_.  A _composite role_ is a role that has one or more additional roles associated with it.  When a composite role is mapped to the user, the user also gains the roles associated with that composite.  This inheritance is recursive so any composite of composites also gets inherited."

In this example, the `employee` realm-level role was associated with the `developer` composite role.  Any user with the `developer` role will now also inherit the `employee` role too."
