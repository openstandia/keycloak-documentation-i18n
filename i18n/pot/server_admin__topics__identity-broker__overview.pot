"Now {project_name} is going to check if the response from the identity "

"skip that if the user already exists.  If it is a new user, {project_name} "
"may ask the identity provider for information about the user if that info "

"federation_.  If the user already exists {project_name} may ask him to link "
"the identity returned from the identity provider with his existing account.  "
"We call this process _account linking_.  What exactly is done is "
"configurable and can be specified by setup of <<_identity_broker_first_login,"
"First Login Flow>> . At the end of this step, {project_name} authenticates "

"Connect, OAuth, etc) was used or how the user's identity was validated.  "
