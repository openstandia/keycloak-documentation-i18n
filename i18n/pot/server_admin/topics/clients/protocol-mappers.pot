"Applications that receive ID Tokens, Access Tokens, or SAML assertions may "
"need or want different user metadata and roles.  {project_name} allows you "
"to define what exactly is transferred.  You can hardcode roles, claims and "
"custom attributes.  You can pull user metadata into a token or assertion.  "
"You can rename roles.  Basically you have a lot of control of what exactly "
"goes back to the client."

"Within the Admin Console, if you go to an application you've registered, "

"The new client does not have any built-in mappers, however it usually "
"inherits some mappers from the client scopes as described in the "
"<<_client_scopes, client scopes section>>. Protocol mappers map things like, "
"for example, email address to a specific claim in the identity and access "
"token.  Their function should each be self explanatory from their name.  "
"There are additional pre-configured mappers that are not attached to the "
"client that you can add by clicking the `Add Builtin` button."

"Each mapper has common settings as well as additional ones depending on "

"Most OIDC mappers also allow you to control where the claim gets put.  You "

msgid "Priority order"
msgstr ""

"Mapper implementations have _priority order_. This priority order is not the "
"configuration property of the mapper; rather, it is the property of the "
"concrete implementation of the mapper."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Mappers are sorted in the admin console by the order in the list of mappers "
"and the changes in the token or assertion will be applied using that order "
"with the lowest being applied first. This means that implementations which "
"are dependent on other implementations are processed in the needed order."

#. type: Plain text

"For example, when we first want to compute the roles which will be included "
"with a token, we first resolve audiences based on those roles. Then, we "
"process a JavaScript script that uses the roles and audiences already "
"available in the token."
