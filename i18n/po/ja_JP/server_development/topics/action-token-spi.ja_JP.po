msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "When an action token is passed to a {project_name} endpoint `_KEYCLOAK_ROOT_/auth/realms/master/login-actions/action-token` via `key` parameter, it is validated and a proper action token handler is executed. The processing always takes place in a context of an authentication session, either a fresh one or the action token service joins an existing authentication session (details are described below). The action token handler can perform actions prescribed by the token (often it alters the authentication session) and results into a HTTP response (e.g. it can continue in authentication or display an information/error page). These steps are detailed below."

msgid "How to Create an Action Token"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "As action token is just a signed JWT with few mandatory fields (see <<_action_token_anatomy,Anatomy of action token>> above), it can be serialized and signed as such using Keycloak's `JWSBuilder` class. This way has been already implemented in `serialize(session, realm, uriInfo)` method of `org.keycloak.authentication.actiontoken.DefaultActionToken` and can be leveraged by implementors by using that class for tokens instead of plain `JsonWebToken`."

msgid "To plug your own action token and its handler, you need to implement few interfaces on server side:"

#. type: Plain text
#, no-wrap
msgid ""
"`org.keycloak.authentication.actiontoken.ActionTokenHandler` - actual handler of action token for a particular\n"
"action (i.e. for a given value of `typ` token field).   \n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The central method in that interface is `handleToken(token, context)` which defines actual operation executed upon receiving the action token. Usually it is some alteration of authentication session notes but generally it can be arbitrary. This method is only called if all verifiers (including those defined in `getVerifiers(context)`) have succeeded, and it is guaranteed that the `token` would be of the class returned by `getTokenClass()` method."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "To be able to determine whether the action token was issued for the current authentication session as described in <<determining-auth-sess,Item 2 above>>, method for extracting authentication session ID has to be declared in `getAuthenticationSessionIdFromToken(token, context)` method. The implementation in `DefaultActionToken` returns the value of `asid` field from the token if it is defined. Note that you can override that method to return current authentication session ID regardless of the token - that way you can create tokens that would step into the ongoing authentication flow before any authentication flow would be started."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "If the authentication session from the token does not match the current one, the action token handler would be asked to start a fresh one by calling `startFreshAuthenticationSession(token, context)`. It can throw a `VerificationException` (or better its more descriptive variant `ExplainedTokenVerificationException`) to signal that would be forbidden."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The token handler also determines via method `canUseTokenRepeatedly(token, context)` whether the token would be invalidated after it is used and authentication completes. Note that if you would have a flow utilizing multiple action token, only the last token would be invalidated. In that case, you should use `org.keycloak.models.ActionTokenStoreProvider` in action token handler to invalidate the used tokens manually."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Default implementation of most of the `ActionTokenHandler` methods is the `org.keycloak.authentication.actiontoken.AbstractActionTokenHander` abstract class in `keycloak-services` module. The only method that needs to be implemented is `handleToken(token, context)` that performs the actual action."
msgstr ""

msgid "`org.keycloak.authentication.actiontoken.ActionTokenHandlerFactory` - factory that instantiates action token handler. Implementations have to override `getId()` to return value that must match precisely the value of `typ` field in the action token."

msgid "Note that you have to register the custom `ActionTokenHandlerFactory` implementation as explained in the <<_providers,Service Provider Interfaces>> section of this guide."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "If the action token you are implementing contains any custom fields that should be serializabled to JSON fields, you should consider implementing a descendant of `org.keycloak.representations.JsonWebToken` class that would implement `org.keycloak.models.ActionTokenKeyModel` interface. In that case, you can take advantage of the existing `org.keycloak.authentication.actiontoken.DefaultActionToken` class as it already satisfies both these conditions, and either use it directly or implement its child, the fields of which can be annotated with appropriate Jackson annotations, e.g. `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty` to serialize them to JSON."
