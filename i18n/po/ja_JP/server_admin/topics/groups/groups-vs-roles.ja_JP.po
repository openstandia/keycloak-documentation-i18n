"Aren't <<_composite-roles,Composite Roles>> also similar to Groups? "
"Logically they provide the same exact functionality, but the difference is "
"conceptual.  Composite roles should be used to apply the permission model to"
" your set of services and applications.  Groups should focus on collections "
"of users and their roles in your organization.  Use groups to manage users."
"  Use composite roles to manage applications and services."
