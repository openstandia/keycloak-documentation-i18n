"link:http://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] (OIDC) is an authentication "
"protocol that is an extension of link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/"
"rfc6749[OAuth 2.0].  While OAuth 2.0 is only a framework for building "
"authorization protocols and is mainly incomplete, OIDC is a full-fledged "
"authentication and authorization protocol.  OIDC also makes heavy use of the "
"link:https://jwt.io[Json Web Token] (JWT) set of standards.  These standards "
"define an identity token JSON format and ways to digitally sign and encrypt "
"that data in a compact and web-friendly way."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"There are really two types of use cases when using OIDC.  The first is an "
"application that asks the {project_name} server to authenticate a user for "
"them.  After a successful login, the application will receive an _identity "
"token_ and an _access token_.  The _identity token_ contains information "
"about the user such as username, email, and other profile information.  The "
"_access token_ is digitally signed by the realm and contains access "
"information (like user role mappings) that the application can use to "
"determine what resources the user is allowed to access on the application."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The second type of use cases is that of a client that wants to gain access "
"to remote services.  In this case, the client asks {project_name} to obtain "
"an _access token_ it can use to invoke on other remote services on behalf of "
"the user.  {project_name} authenticates the user then asks the user for "
"consent to grant access to the client requesting it.  The client then "
"receives the _access token_.  This _access token_ is digitally signed by the "
"realm.  The client can make REST invocations on remote services using this "
"_access token_.  The REST service extracts the _access token_, verifies the "
"signature of the token, then decides based on access information within the "
"token whether or not to process the request."

msgid "OIDC Auth Flows"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"OIDC has different ways for a client or application to authenticate a user "
"and receive an _identity_ and _access_ token.  Which path you use depends "
"greatly on the type of application or client requesting access.  All of "
"these flows are described in the OIDC and OAuth 2.0 specifications so only a "
"brief overview will be provided here."

msgid "Authorization Code Flow"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This is a browser-based protocol and it is what we recommend you use to "
"authenticate and authorize browser-based applications.  It makes heavy use "
"of browser redirects to obtain an _identity_ and _access_ token.  Here's a "
"brief summary:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Browser visits application.  The application notices the user is not logged "
"in, so it redirects the browser to {project_name} to be authenticated.  The "
"application passes along a callback URL (a redirect URL) as a query "
"parameter in this browser redirect that {project_name} will use when it "
"finishes authentication."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"{project_name} authenticates the user and creates a one-time, very short "
"lived, temporary code.  {project_name} redirects back to the application "
"using the callback URL provided earlier and additionally adds the temporary "
"code as a query parameter in the callback URL."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The application extracts the temporary code and makes a background out of "
"band REST invocation to {project_name} to exchange the code for an "
"_identity_, _access_ and _refresh_ token.  Once this temporary code has been "
"used once to obtain the tokens, it can never be used again.  This prevents "
"potential replay attacks."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"It is important to note that _access_ tokens are usually short lived and "
"often expired after only minutes.  The additional _refresh_ token that was "
"transmitted by the login protocol allows the application to obtain a new "
"access token after it expires.  This refresh protocol is important in the "
"situation of a compromised system.  If access tokens are short lived, the "
"whole system is only vulnerable to a stolen token for the lifetime of the "
"access token.  Future refresh token requests will fail if an admin has "
"revoked access.  This makes things more secure and more scalable."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Another important aspect of this flow is the concept of a _public_ vs. a "
"_confidential_ client.  _Confidential_ clients are required to provide a "
"client secret when they exchange the temporary codes for tokens.  _Public_ "
"clients are not required to provide this client secret.  _Public_ clients "
"are perfectly fine so long as HTTPS is strictly enforced and you are very "
"strict about what redirect URIs are registered for the client.  HTML5/"
"JavaScript clients always have to be _public_ clients because there is no "
"way to transmit the client secret to them in a secure manner.  Again, this "
"is ok so long as you use HTTPS and strictly enforce redirect URI "
"registration.  This guide goes more detail into this in the <<_clients, "
"Managing Clients>> chapter."

"{project_name} also supports the optional https://tools.ietf.org/html/"

msgid "Implicit Flow"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This is a browser-based protocol that is similar to Authorization Code Flow "
"except there are fewer requests and no refresh tokens involved.  We do not "
"recommend this flow as there remains the possibility of _access_ tokens "
"being leaked in the browser history as tokens are transmitted via redirect "
"URIs (see below).  Also, since this flow doesn't provide the client with a "
"refresh token, access tokens would either have to be long-lived or users "
"would have to re-authenticate when they expired.  This flow is supported "
"because it is in the OIDC and OAuth 2.0 specification.  Here's a brief "
"summary of the protocol:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"{project_name} authenticates the user and creates an _identity_ and _access_ "

msgid "Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (Direct Access Grants)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This is referred to in the Admin Console as _Direct Access Grants_. This is "
"used by REST clients that want to obtain a token on behalf of a user.  It is "
"one HTTP POST request that contains the credentials of the user as well as "
"the id of the client and the client's secret (if it is a confidential "
"client).  The user's credentials are sent within form parameters.  The HTTP "
"response contains _identity_, _access_, and _refresh_ tokens."

"This is also used by REST clients, but instead of obtaining a token that "
