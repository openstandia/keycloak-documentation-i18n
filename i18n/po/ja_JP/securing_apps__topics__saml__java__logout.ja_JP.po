msgid "There are multiple ways you can logout from a web application.  For Java EE servlet containers, you can call `HttpServletRequest.logout()`. For any other browser application, you can point the browser at any url of your web application that has a security constraint and pass in a query parameter GLO, i.e. `$$http://myapp?GLO=true$$`.  This will log you out if you have an SSO session with your browser."

msgid "Internally, the SAML adapter stores a mapping between the SAML session index, principal name (when known), and HTTP session ID.  This mapping can be maintained in JBoss application server family (Wildfly 10/11, EAP 6/7) across cluster for distributable applications. As a precondition, the HTTP sessions need to be distributed across cluster (i.e. application is marked with `<distributable/>` tag in application's `web.xml`)."
