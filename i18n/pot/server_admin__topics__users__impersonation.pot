"It is often useful for an admin to impersonate a user.  For example, a user "
"may be experiencing a bug in one of your applications and an admin may want "
"to impersonate the user to see if they can duplicate the problem.  Admins "
"with the appropriate permission can impersonate a user.  There are two "
"locations an admin can initiate impersonation.  The first is on the `Users` "
"list tab."

"When impersonating, if the admin and the user are in the same realm, then "

"will remain logged in, but additionally be logged in as the user in that "
