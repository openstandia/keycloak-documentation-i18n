"Applications that receive ID Tokens, Access Tokens, or SAML assertions may "
"need or want different user metadata and roles.  {project_name} allows you "
"to define what exactly is transferred.  You can hardcode roles, claims and "
"custom attributes.  You can pull user metadata into a token or assertion.  "
"You can rename roles.  Basically you have a lot of control of what exactly "
"goes back to the client."

"Each client has several built-in mappers that are created for it by "
"default.  They map things like, for example, email address to a specific "
"claim in the identity and access token.  Their function should each be self "

"that are not attached to the client that you can add by clicking the `Add "
"Builtin` button."
