msgid "Relational Database Setup"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "{project_name} comes with its own embedded Java-based relational database called H2.  This is the default database that {project_name} will use to persist data and really only exists so that you can run the authentication server out of the box.  We highly recommend that you replace it with a more production ready external database.  The H2 database is not very viable in high concurrency situations and should not be used in a cluster either.  The purpose of this chapter is to show you how to connect {project_name} to a more mature database."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "{project_name} uses two layered technologies to persist its relational data.  The bottom layered technology is JDBC.  JDBC is a Java API that is used to connect to a RDBMS.  There are different JDBC drivers per database type that are provided by your database vendor.  This chapter discusses how to configure {project_name} to use one of these vendor-specific drivers."

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The top layered technology for persistence is Hibernate JPA.  This is a object to relational mapping API that maps Java Objects to relational data.  Most deployments of {project_name} will never have to touch the configuration aspects of Hibernate, but we will discuss how that is done if you run into that rare circumstance."
