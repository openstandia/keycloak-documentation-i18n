msgid "This should be set to __true__ if your application serves both a web application and web services (e.g. SOAP or REST).  It allows you to redirect unauthenticated users of the web application to the Keycloak login page, but send an HTTP `401` status code to unauthenticated SOAP or REST clients instead as they would not understand a redirect to the login page.  Keycloak auto-detects SOAP or REST clients based on typical headers like `X-Requested-With`, `SOAPAction` or `Accept`.  The default value is _false_."
