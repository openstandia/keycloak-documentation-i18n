"When a user is loaded by ID, username, or email queries it is cached. When a "
"user is cached, it iterates through the entire `UserModel` interface and "
"pulls this information to a local in-memory-only cache. In a cluster, this "
"cache is still local, but it becomes an invalidation cache. When a user is "
"modified, it is evicted. This eviction event is propagated to the entire "
"cluster so that the other nodes' user cache is also invalidated."
