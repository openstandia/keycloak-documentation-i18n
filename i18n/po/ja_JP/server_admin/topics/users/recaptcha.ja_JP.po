To enable this you need to first go to link:https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/[Google Recaptcha Website] and create an API key so that you can get your reCAPTCHA site key and secret.  (FYI, localhost works by default so you don't have to specify a domain)."

This is to prevent clickjacking attacks.  You need to authorize Google to use the registration page within an iframe.  Go to the `Realm Settings` left menu item and then go to the `Security Defenses` tab.  You will need to add `\\https://www.google.com` to the values of both the `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy` headers."
