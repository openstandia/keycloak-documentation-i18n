msgid "{project_name} cluster nodes are allowed to boot concurrenty.  When {project_name} server instance boots up it may do some database migration, importing, or first time initializations.  A DB lock is used to prevent start actions from conflicting with one another when cluster nodes boot up concurrently."

msgid "By default, the maximum timeout for this lock is 900 seconds.  If a node is waiting on this lock for more than the timeout it will fail to boot.  Typically you won't need to increase/decrease the default value, but just in case it's possible to configure it in `standalone.xml`, `standalone-ha.xml`, or `domain.xml` file in your distribution.  The location of this file depends on your <<_operating-mode, operating mode>>."
