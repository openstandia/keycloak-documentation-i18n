"Otherwise, characters are limited to those contained in database encoding "
"which is often 8-bit. However, for some database systems, it is possible to "
"enable UTF-8 encoding of Unicode characters and use full Unicode character "
"set in all text fields. Often, this is counterbalanced by shorter maximum "
"length of the strings than in case of 8-bit encodings."

"Some of the databases require special settings to database and/or JDBC "

"Technically, the key criterion for Unicode support for all fields is whether "
"the database allows setting of Unicode character set for `VARCHAR` and "
"`CHAR` fields. If yes, there is a high chance that Unicode will be "
"plausible, usually at the expense of field length. If it only supports "
"Unicode in `NVARCHAR` and `NCHAR` fields, Unicode support for all text "
"fields is unlikely as Keycloak schema uses `VARCHAR` and `CHAR` fields "
"extensively."

"If the database character set is not Unicode, then to use Unicode characters "
