"Any realm or client level role can be turned into a _composite role_.  A "
"_composite role_ is a role that has one or more additional roles associated "
"with it.  When a composite role is mapped to the user, the user also gains "
"the roles associated with that composite.  This inheritance is recursive so "
"any composite of composites also gets inherited."

"Once you flip this switch the role selection UI will be displayed lower on "
"the page and you'll be able to associate realm level and client level roles "
"to the composite you are creating.  In this example, the `employee` realm-"
"level role was associated with the `developer` composite role.  Any user "
"with the `developer` role will now also inherit the `employee` role too."
