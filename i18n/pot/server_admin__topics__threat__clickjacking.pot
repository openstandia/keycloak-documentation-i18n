"With clickjacking, a malicious site loads the target site in a transparent iFrame overlaid on top of a set of dummy\n"
"buttons that are carefully constructed to be placed directly under important buttons on the target site.\n"
"When a user clicks a visible button, they are actually clicking a button (such as a \"login\" button) on the hidden page.\n"
"An attacker can steal a user's authentication credentials and access their resources.\n"

"By default, every response by {project_name} sets some specific browser headers that can prevent this from happening.\n"
"Specifically, it sets https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034[X-FRAME_OPTIONS] and http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/[Content-Security-Policy].\n"
"You should take a look at the definition of both of these headers as there is a lot of fine-grain browser access you can control.\n"
"In the admin console you can specify the values these headers will have.  Go to the `Realm Settings` left menu item and\n"
"click the `Security Defenses` tab and make sure you are on the `Headers` sub-tab.\n"
