msgid "JavaScript Adapter"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"{project_name} comes with a client-side JavaScript library that can be used "
"to secure HTML5/JavaScript applications. The JavaScript adapter has built-in "
"support for Cordova applications."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The library can be retrieved directly from the {project_name} server at `/"
"auth/js/keycloak.js` and is also distributed as a ZIP archive."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"A best practice is to load the JavaScript adapter directly from "
"{project_name} Server as it will automatically be updated when you upgrade "
"the server. If you copy the adapter to your web application instead, make "
"sure you upgrade the adapter only after you have upgraded the server."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"One important thing to note about using client-side applications is that the "
"client has to be a public client as there is no secure way to store client "
"credentials in a client-side application. This makes it very important to "
"make sure the redirect URIs you have configured for the client are correct "
"and as specific as possible."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"To use the JavaScript adapter you must first create a client for your "
"application in the {project_name} Administration Console. Make sure `public` "
"is selected for `Access Type`."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"You also need to configure valid redirect URIs and valid web origins. Be as "
"specific as possible as failing to do so may result in a security "
"vulnerability."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Once the client is created click on the `Installation` tab select `Keycloak "
"OIDC JSON` for `Format Option` then click `Download`. The downloaded "
"`keycloak.json` file should be hosted on your web server at the same "
"location as your HTML pages."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can skip the configuration file and manually configure "
"the adapter."

"With this flow the {project_name} server returns an authorization code, not "

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
