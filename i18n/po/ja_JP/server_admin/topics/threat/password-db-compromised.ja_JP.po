"{project_name} does not store passwords in raw text.  It stores a hash of "
"them using the PBKDF2 algorithm.  It actually uses a default of 20,000 "
"hashing iterations! This is the security community's recommended number of "
"iterations.  This can be a rather large performance hit on your system as "
"PBKDF2, by design, gobbles up a significant amount of CPU.  It is up to you "
"to decide how serious you want to be to protect your password database."
