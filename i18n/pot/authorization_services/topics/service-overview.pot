"OAuth2 clients (such as front end applications) can obtain access tokens "
"from the server using the token endpoint and use these same tokens to access "
"resources protected by a resource server (such as back end services). In the "
"same way, {project_name} Authorization Services provide extensions to OAuth2 "
"to allow access tokens to be issued based on the processing of all policies "
"associated with the resource(s) or scope(s) being requested. This means that "
"resource servers can enforce access to their protected resources based on "
"the permissions granted by the server and held by an access token. In "
"{project_name} Authorization Services the access token with permissions is "
"called a Requesting Party Token or RPT for short."

"In addition to the issuance of RPTs, {project_name} Authorization Services "
"also provides a set of RESTful endpoints that allow resources servers to "
"manage their protected resources, scopes, permissions and policies, helping "
"developers to extend or integrate these capabilities into their applications "
"in order to support fine-grained authorization."
