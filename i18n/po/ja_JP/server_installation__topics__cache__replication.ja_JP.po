msgid "Replication and Failover"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The `sessions`, `authenticationSessions`, `offlineSessions` and `loginFailures` caches are the only caches that may perform replication.  Entries are not replicated to every single node, but instead one or more nodes is chosen as an owner of that data.  If a node is not the owner of a specific cache entry it queries the cluster to obtain it.  What this means for failover is that if all the nodes that own a piece of data go down, that data is lost forever.  By default, {project_name} only specifies one owner for data.  So if that one node goes down that data is lost.  This usually means that users will be logged out and will have to login again."
