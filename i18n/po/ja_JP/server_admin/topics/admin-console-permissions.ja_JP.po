"Each realm created on the {project_name} has a dedicated Admin Console from "
"which that realm can be managed.  The `master` realm is a special realm that "
"allows admins to manage more than one realm on the system.  You can also "
"define fine-grained access to users in different realms to manage the "
"server.  This chapter goes over all the scenarios for this."
