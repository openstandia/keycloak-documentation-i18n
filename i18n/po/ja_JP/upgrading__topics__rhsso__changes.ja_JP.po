msgid "For RH-SSO 7.0 only one set of keys could be associated with a realm. This meant that when changing the keys all current cookies and tokens would be invalidated and all users would have to re-authenticate. For RH-SSO 7.1 support for multiple keys for one realm has been added. At any given time one set of keys is the active keys used for signatures, but there can be multiple keys used to verify signatures. This means that old cookies and tokens can be verified, then refreshed with the new signatures, allowing users to remain authenticated when keys are changed. There are also some changes to how keys are managed through the Admin Console and Admin REST API; for more details see link:{adminguide_link}#realm_keys[Realm Keys] in the _{adminguide_name}_.\n"

To use encrypted assertions, ensure your service providers support this encryption scheme. In the event that you have service providers that do not support RSA-OAEP, RH-SSO can be configured to use the legacy RSA-v1.5 encryption scheme by starting the server with the system property “keycloak.saml.key_trans.rsa_v1.5” set to true. If you do this  you should upgrade your service providers as soon as possible to be able to revert to the more secure RSA-OAEP encryption scheme.\n"
