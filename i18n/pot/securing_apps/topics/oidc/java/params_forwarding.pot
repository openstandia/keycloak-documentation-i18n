"The {project_name} initial authorization endpoint request has support for "
"various parameters. Most of the parameters are described in http://openid."
"net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationEndpoint[OIDC "
"specification]. Some parameters are added automatically by the adapter based "
"on the adapter configuration. However, there are also a few parameters that "
"can be added on a per-invocation basis. When you open the secured "
"application URI, the particular parameter will be forwarded to the "
"{project_name} authorization endpoint."

"For example, if you request an offline token, then you can open the secured "
"application URI with the `scope` parameter like:"

"and the parameter `scope=offline_access` will be automatically forwarded to "

msgid ""
"scope - Use a space-delimited list of scopes. A space-delimited list "
"typically references link:{adminguide_link}#_client_scopes[Client scopes] "
"defined on particular client. Note that the scope `openid` will be always be "
"added to the list of scopes by the adapter. For example, if you enter the "
"scope options `address phone`, then the request to {project_name} will "
"contain the scope parameter `scope=openid address phone`."

"prompt - {project_name} supports these settings: ** `login` - SSO will be "
"ignored and the {project_name} login page will be always shown, even if the "
"user is already authenticated ** `none` - The login page will never be "
"shown; instead the user will be redirected to the application, with an error "
"if the user is not yet authenticated. This setting allows you to create a "
"filter/interceptor on the application side and show a custom error page to "
"the user. See more details in the specification."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"max_age - Used only if a user is already authenticated. Specifies maximum "
"permitted time for the authentication to persist, measured from when the "
"user authenticated. If user is authenticated longer than `maxAge`, the SSO "
"is ignored and he must re-authenticate."

"login_hint - Used to pre-fill the username/email field on the login form."

"kc_idp_hint - Used to tell {project_name} to skip showing login page and "

"documentation]."

"If you open the URL using the attached parameters, the adapter will not "

"login page if you are already authenticated to the application "
"`mysecredapp` . This behavior may be changed in the future."
