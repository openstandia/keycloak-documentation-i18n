"Authentciation] is an OIDC-Like protocol used to authenticate users against "
"a Docker registry.  {project_name}'s implementation of this protocol allows "
"for a {project_name} authentication server to be used by a Docker client to "
"authenticate against a registry.  While this protocol uses fairly standard "
"token and signature mechanisms, it has a few wrinkles that prevent it from "
"being treated as a true OIDC implementation.  The largest deviations include "
"a very specific JSON format for requests and responses as well as the "
"ability to understand how to map repository names and permissions to the "
"OAuth scope mechanism."

"The link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/auth/token/[Docker API "
"documentation] best describes and illustrates this process, however a brief "
"summary will be given below from the perspective of the {project_name} "
"authentication server."

"This flow assumes that a `docker login` command has already been performed"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The flow begins when the Docker client requests a resource from the Docker "
"registry.  If the resource is protected and no auth token is present in the "
"request, the Docker registry server will respond to the client with a 401 + "
"some information on required permissions and where to find the authorization "
"server."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The Docker client will construct an authentication request based on the 401 "
"response from the Docker registry.  The client will then use the locally "
"cached credentials (from a previously run `docker login` command) as part of "
"a link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617[HTTP Basic Authentication] "
"request to the {project_name} authentication server."

#. type: Plain text

"The {project_name} authentication server will attempt to authenticate the "
"user and return a JSON body containing an OAuth-style Bearer token."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The Docker client will get the bearer token from the JSON response and use "
"it in the Authorization header to request the protected resource."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"When the Docker registry recieves the new request for the protected resource "
"with the token from the {project_name} server, the registry validates the "
"token and grants access to the requested resource (if appropriate)."
