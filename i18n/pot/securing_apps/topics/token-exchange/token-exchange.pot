"In {project_name}, token exchange is the process of using a set of "
"credentials or token to obtain an entirely different token.  A client may "
"want to invoke on a less trusted application so it may want to downgrade the "
"current token it has.  A client may want to exchange a {project_name} token "
"for a token stored for a linked social provider account.  You may want to "
"trust external tokens minted by other {project_name} realms or foreign IDPs. "
"A client may have a need to impersonate a user.  Here's a short summary of "
"the current capabilities of {project_name} around token exchange."
