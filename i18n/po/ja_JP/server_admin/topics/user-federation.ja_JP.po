"Many companies have existing user databases that hold information about "
"users and their passwords or other credentials.  In may cases, it is just "
"not possible to migrate off of those existing stores to a pure "
"{project_name} deployment.  {project_name} can federate existing external "
"user databases.  Out of the box we have support for LDAP and Active "
"Directory.  You can also code your own extension for any custom user "
"databases you might have using our User Storage SPI."

"The way it works is that when a user logs in, {project_name} will look into "
"its own internal user store to find the user.  If it can't find it there it "
"will iterate over every User Storage provider you have configured for the "
"realm until it finds a match.  Data from the external store is mapped into a "
"common user model that is consumed by the {project_name} runtime.  This "
"common user model can then be mapped to OIDC token claims and SAML assertion "
"attributes."

"External user databases rarely have every piece of data need to support all "
"the features that {project_name} has.  In this case, the User Storage "
"Provider can opt to store some things locally in the {project_name} user "
"store.  Some providers even import the user locally and sync periodically "
"with the external store.  All this depends on the capabilities of the "
"provider and how its configured.  For example, your external user store may "
"not support OTP.  Depending on the provider, this OTP support can be handled "
"and stored by {project_name}"
