#. type: Plain text
msgid "Standalone clustered operation mode is for when you want to run {project_name} within a cluster.  This mode requires that you have a copy of the {project_name} distribution on each machine you want to run a server instance.  This mode can be very easy to deploy initially, but can become quite cumbersome. To make a configuration change you'll have to modify each distribution on each machine.  For a large cluster this can become time consuming and error prone."

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The distribution has a mostly pre-configured app server configuration file for running within a cluster.  It has all the specific infrastructure settings for networking, databases, caches, and discovery.  This file resides in _.../standalone/configuration/standalone-ha.xml_.  There's a few things missing from this configuration.  You can't run {project_name} in a cluster without a configuring a shared database connection.  You also need to deploy some type of load balancer in front of the cluster.  The <<_clustering,clustering>> and <<_database,database>> sections of this guide walk you though these things."
