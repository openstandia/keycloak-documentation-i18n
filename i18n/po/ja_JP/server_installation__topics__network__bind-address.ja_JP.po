msgid "By default {project_name} binds to the localhost loopback address `127.0.0.1`.  That's not a very useful default if you want the authentication server available on your network.  Generally, what we recommend is that you deploy a reverse proxy or load balancer on a public network and route traffic to individual {project_name} server instances on a private network.  In either case though, you still need to set up your network interfaces to bind to something other than `localhost`."

The `management` interface corresponds to sockets opened up by the management layer of the {appserver_name}.  Specifically the sockets which allow you to use the `jboss-cli.sh` command line interface and the {appserver_name} web console."
