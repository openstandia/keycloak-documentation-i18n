msgid "TOTP vs. HOTP"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"There are two different algorithms to choose from for your OTP generators.  "
"Time Based (TOTP) and Counter Based (HOTP).  For TOTP, your token generator "
"will hash the current time and a shared secret.  The server validates the "
"OTP by comparing the all hashes within a certain window of time to the "
"submitted value.  So, TOTPs are valid only for a short window of time "
"(usually 30 seconds).  For HOTP a shared counter is used instead of the "
"current time.  The server increments the counter with each successful OTP "
"login.  So, valid OTPs only change after a successful login."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"TOTP is considered a little more secure because the matchable OTP is only "
"valid for a short window of time while the OTP for HOTP can be valid for an "
"indeterminate amount of time.  HOTP is much more user friendly as the user "
"won't have to hurry to enter in their OTP before the time interval is up.  "
"With the way {project_name} has implemented TOTP this distinction becomes a "
"little more blurry.  HOTP requires a database update every time the server "
"wants to increment the counter.  This can be a performance drain on the "
"authentication server when there is heavy load.  So, to provide a more "
"efficient alternative, TOTP does not remember passwords used.  This bypasses "
"the need to do any DB updates, but the downside is that TOTPs can be re-used "
"in the valid time interval.  For future versions of {project_name} it is "
"planned that you will be able to configure whether TOTP checks older OTPs in "
"the time interval."

"How many intervals ahead should the server try and match the hash? This "

"server get out of sync.  The default value of 1 is usually good enough.  For "
"example, if the time interval for a new token is every 30 seconds, the "
"default value of 1 means that it will only accept valid tokens in that 30 "
"second window.  Each increment of this config value will increase the valid "
"window by 30 seconds."
