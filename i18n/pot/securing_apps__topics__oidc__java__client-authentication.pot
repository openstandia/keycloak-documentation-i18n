"When a confidential OIDC client needs to send a backchannel request (for "
"example, to exchange code for the token, or to refresh the token) it needs "
"to authenticate against the {project_name} server. By default, there are two "
"ways to authenticate the client: client ID and client secret, or client "
"authentication with signed JWT."

"{project_name} must have the public key or certificate of the client so that "
"it can verify the signature on JWT. In {project_name} you need to configure "
"client credentials for your client. First you need to choose `Signed JWT` as "
"the method of authenticating your client in the tab `Credentials` in "
"administration console.  Then you can choose to either: ** Configure the "
"JWKS URL where {project_name} can download the client's public keys. This "
"can be a URL such as \\http://myhost.com/myapp/k_jwks (see details above). "
"This option is the most flexible, since the client can rotate its keys "
"anytime and {project_name} then always downloads new keys when needed "
"without needing to change the configuration. More accurately, {project_name} "
"downloads new keys when it sees the token signed by an unknown `kid` (Key "
"ID).  ** Upload the client's public key or certificate, either in PEM "
"format, in JWK format, or from the keystore. With this option, the public "
"key is hardcoded and must be changed when the client generates a new key "
"pair.  You can even generate your own keystore from the {project_name} "
"admininstration console if you don't have your own available.  For more "
"details on how to set up the {project_name} administration console see "
