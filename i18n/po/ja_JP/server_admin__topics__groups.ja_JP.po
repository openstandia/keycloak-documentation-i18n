"Subgroups inherit the attributes and role mappings from the parent.\n"
"This applies to the user as well.\n"
"So, if you have a parent group and a child group and a user that only belongs to the child group, the user inherits the attributes and role mappings of both the parent and child.\n"
"In this example, we have a top level `Sales` group and a child `North America` subgroup.  To add a group, click on the\n"
