"The second type of use cases is that of a client that wants to gain access "
"to remote services.  In this case, the client asks {project_name} to obtain "
"an _access token_ it can use to invoke on other remote services on behalf of "
"the user.  {project_name} authenticates the user then asks the user for "
"consent to grant access to the client requesting it.  The client then "
"receives the _access token_.  This _access token_ is digitally signed by the "
"realm.  The client can make REST invocations on remote services using this "
"_access token_.  The REST service extracts the _access token_, verifies the "
"signature of the token, then decides based on access information within the "

"There are really two types of use cases when using OIDC.  The first is an "
"application that asks the {project_name} server to authenticate a user for "
"them.  After a successful login, the application will receive an _identity "
"token_ and an _access token_.  The _identity token_ contains information "
"about the user such as username, email, and other profile information.  The "
"_access token_ is digitally signed by the realm and contains access "
"information (like user role mappings) that the application can use to "
"determine what resources the user is allowed to access on the application."

"Browser visits application.  The application notices the user is not logged "

"It is important to note that _access_ tokens are usually short lived and "
"often expired after only minutes.  The additional _refresh_ token that was "
"transmitted by the login protocol allows the application to obtain a new "
"access token after it expires.  This refresh protocol is important in the "
"situation of a compromised system.  If access tokens are short lived, the "
"whole system is only vulnerable to a stolen token for the lifetime of the "
"access token.  Future refresh token requests will fail if an admin has "
"revoked access.  This makes things more secure and more scalable."

"Another important aspect of this flow is the concept of a _public_ vs. a "
"_confidential_ client.  _Confidential_ clients are required to provide a "
"client secret when they exchange the temporary codes for tokens.  _Public_ "
"clients are not required to provide this client secret.  _Public_ clients "
"are perfectly fine so long as HTTPS is strictly enforced and you are very "
"strict about what redirect URIs are registered for the client.  HTML5/"
"JavaScript clients always have to be _public_ clients because there is no "
"way to transmit the client secret to them in a secure manner.  Again, this "
"is ok so long as you use HTTPS and strictly enforce redirect URI "
"registration.  This guide goes more detail into this in the <<_clients, "
"Managing Clients>> chapter."

"This is a browser-based protocol that is similar to Authorization Code Flow "
"except there are fewer requests and no refresh tokens involved.  We do not "
"recommend this flow as there remains the possibility of _access_ tokens "
"being leaked in the browser history as tokens are transmitted via redirect "
"URIs (see below).  Also, since this flow doesn't provide the client with a "
"refresh token, access tokens would either have to be long-lived or users "
"would have to re-authenticate when they expired.  This flow is supported "
