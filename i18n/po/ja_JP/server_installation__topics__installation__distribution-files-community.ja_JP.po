To install the Keycloak Service Pack, just unzip it in the root directory of your WildFly distribution, open the bin directory in a shell and run `./jboss-cli.[sh|bat] --file=keycloak-install.cli`."

This distribution is only recommended for those that want to test drive Keycloak.  We do not support users that run the demo distribution in production."
