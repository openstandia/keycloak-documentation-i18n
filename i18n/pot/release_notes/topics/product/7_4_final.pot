"Red Hat is proud to announce the release of version 7.4 of {project_name} "
"(RH-SSO). RH-SSO is based on the Keycloak project, and enables you to secure "
"your web applications by providing Web SSO capabilities based on popular "
"standards such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0. The RH-SSO server "
"acts as an OpenID Connect or SAML-based identity provider (IdP), allowing "
"your enterprise user directory or third-party IdP to secure your "
"applications via standards-based security tokens."

msgid "Authentication improvements"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"RH-SSO now offers support for W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn). Adding "
"support for WebAuthn resulted in more refactoring in the Authentication "
"flows configuration and in the credentials management. This change provides "
"more flexibility for administrators when configuring authentication flows "
"and more flexibility for users when selecting the preferred authentication "
"mechanism."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The improvements for authentication and credentials management have multiple "
"benefits."
msgstr ""

#. type: Title ===

msgid "Two-factor authentication"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"It is now easier for the administrator to configure two-factor "
"authentication and select between multiple alternatives for two-factor "
"authentication. For example, an administrator can configure OTP and WebAuthn "
"as alternatives in the authentication flow, which allows users to choose "
"between those mechanisms during authentication."

msgid "Passwordless authentication"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"It is easier for the administrator to configure passwordless authentication. "
"This feature can be useful for WebAuthn, which can be used as a two-factor "
"authentication mechanism and a passwordless authentication mechanism. In the "
"case of passwordless, a user who authenticates with WebAuth is not required "
"to provide a password during authentication. It is easier to combine "
"passwordless and two-factor authentication."
msgstr ""

#. type: Title ===
#, no-wrap
msgid "Identity-first authentication"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"An administrator can configure an authentication flow in a way that users "
"provide only a username on the first form during authentication. This change "
"allows better flexibility as RH-SSO can better detect what is the preferred "
"authentication mechanism for target users and show authentication forms "
"based on that."
msgstr ""

#. type: Title ===

msgid "Conditional authenticators"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"RH-SSO offers the possibility to add conditions at specific places of the "
"authentication flow. Therefore, a user is required to authenticate with an "
"authentication mechanism just if the specified condition is met. This means "
"that for example two-factor authentication will be required for members of a "
"specific role. Another example is that the two-factor authentication "
"mechanism will be required for users with a configured two-factor credential."

"Adding conditional authenticators allowed us to remove the OPTIONAL "
"requirement for the authentication executions. Conditional authenticators "
"are more flexible and allow for support of everything that was previously "
"allowed with the OPTIONAL authentication execution requirement. If you use "

"migrated automatically."

"authentication mechanism will be used."

"Administrators can see all credentials of a particular user and some public "

"For this release, RH-SSO adds a vault for storing and retrieving secrets.  "
"The vault provides secure, automated access to secrets to eliminate any "
"storage of clear text values.  By using a vault, the database contains the "
