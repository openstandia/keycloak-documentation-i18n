"The recommended network architecture for deploying {project_name} is to set "
"up an HTTP/HTTPS load balancer on a public IP address that routes requests "

"clustering connections and provides a nice means of protecting the servers."

"By default, there is nothing to prevent unauthorized nodes from joining the cluster and broadcasting multicast messages.\n"
"      This is why cluster nodes should be in a private network, with a firewall protecting them from outside attacks.\n"
