"There are a few things you can do to mitigate access tokens and refresh "
"tokens from being stolen. The most important thing is to enforce SSL/HTTPS "
"communication between {project_name} and its clients and applications. It "
"might seem obvious, but since {project_name} does not have SSL enabled by "
"default, an administrator might not realize that it is necessary."

"Another thing you can do to mitigate leaked access tokens is to shorten "
"their lifespans.  You can specify this within the <<_timeouts, timeouts "
"page>>.  Short lifespans (minutes) for access tokens for clients and "
"applications to refresh their access tokens after a short amount of time. If "
"an admin detects a leak, they can logout all user sessions to invalidate "
"these refresh tokens or set up a revocation policy. Making sure refresh "
"tokens always stay private to the client and are never transmitted ever is "
"very important as well."

"If an access token or refresh token is compromised, the first thing you "
"should do is go to the admin console and push a not-before revocation policy "
"to all applications. This will enforce that any tokens issued prior to that "
"date are now invalid. Pushing new not-before policy will also ensure that "
"application will be forced to download new public keys from {project_name}, "
"hence it is also useful for the case, when you think that realm signing key "
"was compromised.  More info in the <<realm_keys, keys chapter>>."
