"It is often useful for an admin to impersonate a user.  For example, a user "
"may be experiencing a bug in one of your applications and an admin may want "
"to impersonate the user to see if they can duplicate the problem.  Admins "
"with the appropriate permission can impersonate a user.  There are two "
"locations an admin can initiate impersonation.  The first is on the `Users` "
"list tab."

"When impersonating, if the admin and the user are in the same realm, then "
"the admin will be logged out and automatically logged in as the user being "
"impersonated.  If the admin and user are not in the same realm, the admin "
"will remain logged in, but additionally be logged in as the user in that "
"user's realm.  In both cases, the browser will be redirected to the "
"impersonated user's User Account Management page."
