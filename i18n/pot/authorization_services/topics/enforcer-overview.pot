"Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is a design pattern and as such you can "
"implement it in different ways. {project_name} provides all the necessary "
"means to implement PEPs for different platforms, environments, and "
"programming languages. {project_name} Authorization Services presents a "
"RESTful API, and leverages OAuth2 authorization capabilities for fine-"
"grained authorization using a centralized authorization server."

"A PEP is responsible for enforcing access decisions from the {project_name} "
"server where these decisions are taken by evaluating the policies associated "
"with a protected resource. It acts as a filter or interceptor in your "
"application in order to check whether or not a particular request to a "
"protected resource can be fulfilled based on the permissions granted by "
"these decisions."

"If you are using any of the {project_name} OIDC adapters, you can easily "
"enable the policy enforcer by adding the following property to your "
"*keycloak.json* file:"

"When you enable the policy enforcer all requests sent your application are "

"Policy enforcement is strongly linked to your application's paths and the "
"<<_resource_overview, resources>> you created for a resource server using "
"the {project_name} Administration Console. By default, when you create a "
"resource server, {project_name} creates a <<_resource_server_default_config, "
"default configuration>> for your resource server so you can enable policy "
"enforcement quickly."
