If you want to use existing user, select it for edit, otherwise create a new user. Go to `Role Mappings` tab. Under `Client Roles` select `realm-management`. Under `Available Roles` select `manage-client` for full set of client management permissions. Alternatively you can choose `view-clients` for read-only or `create-client` for ability to create new clients.  These permissions grant user the capability to perform operations without the use of `Initial Access Token` or `Registration Access Token`."

msgid "It's possible to not assign users any of `realm-management` roles. In that case user can still login with `Registration Client CLI` but will not be able to use it without having possession of an `Initial Access Token`.

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "By default the `Client Registration CLI` identifies as `admin-cli` client which is automatically configured for every new realm.  No additional client configuration is required when using login with a username. You may wish to strengthen security by configuring the client `Access Type` as `Confidential`, and under `Credentials` tab select `ClientId and Secret`. When running `kcreg config credentials` you would then also have to provide a secret e.g. by using `--secret`."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "If you want to use a separate client configuration for `Registration Client CLI` then you can create a new client - for example you can call it `reg-cli`. When running `kcreg config credentials` you then need to specify a `clientId` to use e.g. `--client reg-cli`."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "If you want to use a service account associated with the client, then you need to enable a service account. In `Admin Client` you go to `Clients` section, and select a client for edit.

#. type: Plain text
msgid "You can use `--config` option at any time to point to a different file / location. This way you can mantain multiple authenticated sessions in parallel. It is safest to perform operations tied to a single config file from a single thread."
