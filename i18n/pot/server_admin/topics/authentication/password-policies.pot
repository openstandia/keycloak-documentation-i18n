"Each new realm created has no password policies associated with it.  Users "
"can have as short, as long, as complex, as insecure a password, as they "
"want.  Simple settings are fine for development or learning {project_name}, "
"but unacceptable in production environments.  {project_name} has a rich set "
"of password policies you can enable through the Admin Console."

"Passwords are not stored as clear text. Instead they are hashed using "

"This value specifies the number of times a password will be hashed before it "

"the rare case that a hacker gets access to your password database. Once they "
"have access to the database, they can reverse engineer user passwords.  The "
"industry recommended value for this parameter changes every year as CPU "
"power improves. A higher hashing iteration value takes more CPU power for "
"hashing, and can impact performance. You'll have to weigh what is more "
"important to you. Performance or protecting your passwords stores.  There "
"may be more cost effective ways of protecting your password stores."
