msgstr ""

msgid "link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] (OIDC) is an authentication protocol that is an extension of link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0]. While OAuth 2.0 is only a framework for building authorization protocols and is mainly incomplete, OIDC is a full-fledged authentication and authorization protocol.  OIDC also makes heavy use of the link:https://jwt.io[Json Web Token] (JWT) set of standards.  These standards define an identity token JSON format and ways to digitally sign and encrypt that data in a compact and web-friendly way."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are really two types of use cases when using OIDC.  The first is an application that asks the {project_name} server to authenticate a user for them.  After a successful login, the application will receive an _identity token_ and an _access token_.  The _identity token_ contains information about the user such as username, email, and other profile information.  The _access token_ is digitally signed by the realm and contains access information (like user role mappings) that the application can use to determine what resources the user is allowed to access on the application."
msgstr ""

msgid "The second type of use cases is that of a client that wants to gain access to remote services.  In this case, the client asks {project_name} to obtain an _access token_ it can use to invoke on other remote services on behalf of the user.  {project_name} authenticates the user then asks the user for consent to grant access to the client requesting it.  The client then receives the _access token_.  This _access token_ is digitally signed by the realm.  The client can make REST invocations on remote services using this _access token_.  The REST service extracts the _access token_, verifies the signature of the token, then decides based on access information within the token whether or not to process the request."
msgstr ""

msgid "SAML 2.0"
msgstr ""

msgid "link:http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications[SAML 2.0] is a similar specification to OIDC but a lot older and more mature.  It has its roots in SOAP and the plethora of WS-* specifications so it tends to be a bit more verbose than OIDC.  SAML 2.0 is primarily an authentication protocol that works by exchanging XML documents between the authentication server and the application.  XML signatures and encryption are used to verify requests and responses."
msgstr ""

msgid "In {project_name} SAML serves two types of use cases: browser applications and REST invocations."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are really two types of use cases when using SAML.  The first is an application that asks the {project_name} server to authenticate a user for them.  After a successful login, the application will receive an XML document that contains something called a SAML assertion that specifies various attributes about the user.  This XML document is digitally signed by the realm and contains access information (like user role mappings) that the application can use to determine what resources the user is allowed to access on the application."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "In most cases {project_name} recommends using OIDC."
msgstr ""

msgid "SAML tends to be a bit more verbose than OIDC."
msgstr ""

msgid "Beyond verbosity of exchanged data, if you compare the specifications you'll find that OIDC was designed to work with the web while SAML was retrofitted to work on top of the web.  For example, OIDC is also more suited for HTML5/JavaScript applications because it is easier to implement on the client side than SAML. As tokens are in the JSON format, they are easier to consume by JavaScript. You will also find several nice features that make implementing security in your web applications easier. For example, check out the link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#ChangeNotification[iframe trick] that the specification uses to easily determine if a user is still logged in or not."
msgstr ""

msgid "SAML has its uses though. As you see the OIDC specifications evolve you see they implement more and more features that SAML has had for years. What we often see is that people pick SAML over OIDC because of the perception that it is more mature and also because they already have existing applications that are secured with it."

Because of this, you must whitelist this URL as a valid redirect-uri in the client configuration section of the Admin Console."
msgstr ""

msgid "While this mode is easy to setup, it also has some disadvantages:"

msgid "The InApp-Browser might also be slower, especially when rendering more complex themes."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are security concerns to consider, before using this mode, such as that it is possible for the app to gain access to the credentials of the user, as it has full control of the browser rendering the login page, so do not allow its use in apps you do not trust."

While the former are easier to setup and tend to work more reliably, the later offer extra security as they are unique and only the owner of a domain can register them. Custom-URLs are deprecated on iOS. We recommend that you use universal links, combined with a fallback site with a custom-url link on it for best reliability."

msgid "Direct Naked Impersonation"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can make an internal token exchange request without providing a `subject_token`.  This is called a direct naked impersonation because it places a lot of trust in a client as that client can impersonate any user in the realm. You might need this to bridge for applications where it is impossible to obtain a subject token to exchange.  For example, you may be integrating a legacy application that performs login directly with LDAP.  In that case, the legacy app is able to authenticate users itself, but not able to obtain a token."

For example, you might define a `naked-exchange` role and any service account that has that role can do a naked exchange."

msgid "The first is public clients.  Public clients do not have or require a client credential in order to perform an exchange.  Anybody that has a valid token will be able to __impersonate__ the public client and perform the exchanges that public client is allowed to perform.  If there are any untrustworthy clients that are managed by your realm, public clients may open up vulnerabilities in your permission models. This is why direct naked exchanges do not allow public clients and will abort with an error if the calling client is public."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is possible to exchange social tokens provided by Facebook, Google, etc. for a realm token.  Be careful and vigilante on what the exchange token is allowed to do as its not hard to create fake accounts on these social websites.  Use default roles, groups, and identity provider mappers to control what attributes and roles are assigned to the external social user."
msgstr ""

msgid "Direct naked exchanges are quite dangerous.  You are putting a lot of trust in the calling client that it will never leak out its client credentials.  If those credentials are leaked, then the thief can impersonate anybody in your system.  This is in direct contrast to confidential clients that have existing tokens.  You have two factors of authentication, the access token and the client credentials, and you're only dealing with one user.  So use direct naked exchanges sparingly."
