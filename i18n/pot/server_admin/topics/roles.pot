"Roles identify a type or category of user.  `Admin`, `user`, `manager`, and "
"`employee` are all typical roles that may exist in an organization.  "
"Applications often assign access and permissions to specific roles rather "
"than individual users as dealing with users can be too fine grained and hard "
"to manage.  For example, the Admin Console has specific roles which give "
"permission to users to access parts of the Admin Console UI and perform "
"certain actions.  There is a global namespace for roles and each client also "
"has its own dedicated namespace where roles can be defined."
