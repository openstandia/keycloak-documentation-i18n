"When implementing a user storage provider, there's another strategy you can "
"take. Instead of using user federated storage, you can create a user locally "
"in the {project_name} built-in user database and copy attributes from your "
"external store into this local copy. There are many advantages to this "
"approach."

"If you are moving to {project_name} as your official user store and "
