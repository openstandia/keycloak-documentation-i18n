"{project_name} provides a rich set of auditing capabilities.  Every single "
"login action can be recorded and stored in the database and reviewed in the "
"Admin Console.  All admin actions can also be recorded and reviewed.  There "
"is also a Listener SPI with which plugins can listen for these events and "
"perform some action.  Built-in listeners include a simple log file and the "
"ability to send an email if an event occurs."
