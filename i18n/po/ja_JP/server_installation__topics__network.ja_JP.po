msgid "{project_name} can run out of the box with some networking limitations.  For one, all network endpoints bind to `localhost` so the auth server is really only usable on one local machine.  For HTTP based connections, it does not use default ports like 80 and 443.  HTTPS/SSL is not configured out of the box and without it, {project_name} has many security vulnerabilities.  Finally, {project_name} may often need to make secure SSL and HTTPS connections to external servers and thus need a trust store set up so that endpoints can be validated correctly.  This chapter discusses all of these things."
