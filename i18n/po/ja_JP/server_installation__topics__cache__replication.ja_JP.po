"The `sessions`, `authenticationSessions`, `offlineSessions` and "
"`loginFailures` caches are the only caches that may perform replication.  "
"Entries are not replicated to every single node, but instead one or more "
"nodes is chosen as an owner of that data.  If a node is not the owner of a "
"specific cache entry it queries the cluster to obtain it.  What this means "
"for failover is that if all the nodes that own a piece of data go down, that "
"data is lost forever.  By default, {project_name} only specifies one owner "
"for data.  So if that one node goes down that data is lost.  This usually "
"means that users will be logged out and will have to login again."
