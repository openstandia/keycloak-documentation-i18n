"link:http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications[SAML 2.0] is a similar "
"specification to OIDC but a lot older and more mature.  It has its roots in "
"SOAP and the plethora of WS-* specifications so it tends to be a bit more "
"verbose than OIDC.  SAML 2.0 is primarily an authentication protocol that "
"works by exchanging XML documents between the authentication server and the "
"application.  XML signatures and encryption is used to verify requests and "
"responses."

"There is really two types of use cases when using SAML.  The first is an "
"application that asks the {project_name} server to authenticate a user for "
"them.  After a successful login, the application will receive an XML "
"document that contains something called a SAML assertion that specify "
"various attributes about the user.  This XML document is digitally signed by "
"the realm and contains access information (like user role mappings) that the "
"application can use to determine what resources the user is allowed to "
"access on the application."

"The second type of use cases is that of a client that wants to gain access "
"to remote services.  In this case, the client asks {project_name} to obtain "
"an SAML assertion it can use to invoke on other remote services on behalf of "
"the user."

"SAML defines a few different ways to exchange XML documents when executing "

"browser based applications.  The _ECP_ binding covers REST invocations.  "
"There are other binding types but {project_name} only supports those three."

"The user visits the application and the application finds the user is not "

"The SAML _POST_ binding works almost the exact same way as the _Redirect_ "
"binding, but instead of GET requests, XML documents are exchanged by POST "
"requests.  The _POST_ Binding uses JavaScript to trick the browser into "
"making a POST request to the {project_name} server or application when "
"exchanging documents.  Basically HTTP responses contain an HTML document "
"that contains an HTML form with embedded JavaScript.  When the page is "
"loaded, the JavaScript automatically invokes the form.  You really don't "
"need to know about this stuff, but it is a pretty clever trick."
