"rfc7519[JSON Web Tokens (JWT)] digitally signed and encoded using https://"

"realm's public key in your validation code, or lookup and cache the public "
"key using the <<_certificate_endpoint, certificate endpoint>> with the Key "
"ID (KID) embedded within the JWS.  Depending what language you code in, "

"The Authorization Code flow redirects the user agent to {project_name}. Once "

"Authorization Code for an Access Token. However, it does not include a "
"Refresh Token. This results in the need to either permit Access Tokens with "
"a long expiration, which is problematic as it's very hard to invalidate "
"these. Or requires a new redirect to obtain new Access Token once the "
"initial Access Token has expired. The Implicit flow is useful if the "
"application only wants to authenticate the user and deals with logout itself."
