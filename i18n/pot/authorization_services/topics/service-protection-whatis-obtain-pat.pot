"A *protection API token* (PAT) is a special OAuth2 access token with a scope "
"defined as *uma_protection*. When you create a resource server, "
"{project_name} automatically creates a role, _uma_protection_, for the "
"corresponding client application and associates it with the client's service "
"account."
