"Offline access is a feature described in http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess[OpenID Connect specification] .\n"
"The idea is that during login, your client application will request an Offline token instead of a classic Refresh token.\n"
"The application can save this offline token in a database or on disk and can use it later even if user is logged out.\n"
"This is useful if your application needs to do some \"offline\" actions on behalf of user even when the user is not online.\n"
"An example is a periodic backup of some data every night.\n"

"The difference between a classic Refresh token and an Offline token is, that an offline token will never expire and is not subject of `SSO Session Idle timeout` .\n"
"The offline token is valid even after a user logout or server restart.\n"
"However by default you do need to use the offline token for a refresh token action at least once per 30 days (this value, `Offline Session Idle timeout`, can be changed in the administration console in the `Tokens` tab under `Realm Settings`). Also if you enable the option `Revoke refresh tokens`, then each offline token can be used just once.\n"
"So after refresh, you always need to store the new offline token from refresh response into your DB instead of the previous one.\n"

"The client can request an offline token by adding the parameter `scope=offline_access` when sending authorization request to {project_name}.\n"
"The {project_name} OIDC client adapter automatically adds this parameter when you use it to access secured URL of your application (i.e.\n"
"$$http://localhost:8080/customer-portal/secured?scope=offline_access$$). The Direct Access Grant and Service Accounts also\n"
"support offline tokens if you include `scope=offline_access` in the body of the authentication request.\n"
