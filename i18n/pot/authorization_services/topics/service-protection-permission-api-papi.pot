"Resource servers using the UMA protocol can use a specific endpoint to "
"manage permission requests. This endpoint provides a UMA-compliant flow for "
"registering permission requests and obtaining a permission ticket."

"A <<_overview_terminology_permission_ticket, permission ticket>> is a "
"special security token type representing a permission request. Per the UMA "
"specification, a permission ticket is:"

"`A correlation handle that is conveyed from an authorization server to a "
"resource server, from a resource server to a client, and ultimately from a "
"client back to an authorization server, to enable the authorization server "
"to assess the correct policies to apply to a request for authorization data.`"

#. type: Plain text

"_Permission ticket support is limited_.  In the full UMA protocol, resource "
"servers can register permission requests in the server to support "
"authorization flows where a resource owner (the user that owns a resource "
"being requested) can approve access to his resources by third parties, among "
"other ways. This represents one of the main features of the UMA "
"specification: resource owners can control their own resources and the "
"policies that govern them. Currently {project_name} UMA implementation "
"support is very limited in this regard. For example, the system does not "
"store permission tickets on the server and we are essentially using UMA to "
"provide API security and base our authorization offerings. In the future, "
"full support of UMA and other use cases is planned."

"In most cases, you won't need to deal with this endpoint directly. "
"{project_name} provides a <<_enforcer_overview, policy enforcer>> that "
"enables UMA for your resource server so it can obtain a permission ticket "
"from the authorization server, return this ticket to client application, and "
"enforce authorization decisions based on a final requesting party token "
"(RPT)."

#. type: Plain text

"The process of obtaining permission tickets from {project_name} is performed "
"by resource servers and not regular client applications, where permission "
"tickets are obtained when a client tries to access a protected resource "
"without the necessary grants to access the resource. The issuance of "
"permission tickets is an important aspects when using UMA as it allows "
"resource servers to:"

#. type: Plain text

"Abstract from clients the data associated with the resources protected by "
"the resource server"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Register in the {project_name} authorization requests which in turn can be "
"used later in workflows to grant access based on the resource's owner consent"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Decouple resource servers from authorization servers and allow them to "
"protect and manage their resources using different authorization servers"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Client wise, a permission ticket has also important aspects that its worthy "
"to highlight:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Clients don't need to know about how authorization data is associated with "
"protected resources. A permission ticket is completely opaque to clients."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Clients can have access to resources on different resource servers and "
"protected by different authorization servers"
msgstr ""

"These are just some of the benefits brought by UMA where other aspects of "
"UMA are strongly based on permission tickets, specially regarding privacy "
"and user controlled access to their resources."
