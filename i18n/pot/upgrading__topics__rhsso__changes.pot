"For RH-SSO 7.0 only one set of keys could be associated with a realm. This "
"meant that when changing the keys all current cookies and tokens would be "
"invalidated and all users would have to re-authenticate. For RH-SSO 7.1 "
"support for multiple keys for one realm has been added. At any given time "
"one set of keys is the active keys used for signatures, but there can be "
"multiple keys used to verify signatures. This means that old cookies and "
"tokens can be verified, then refreshed with the new signatures, allowing "
"users to remain authenticated when keys are changed. There are also some "
"changes to how keys are managed through the Admin Console and Admin REST "
"API; for more details see link:{adminguide_link}#realm_keys[Realm Keys] in "
"the _{adminguide_name}_."

"To allow seamless key rotation you must remove hard-coded keys from client "
"adapters. The client adapters will automatically retrieve keys from the "
"server as long as the realm key is not specified. Client adapters will also "
"retrieve new keys automatically when keys are rotated."
