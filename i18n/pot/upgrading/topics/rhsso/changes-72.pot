"We have added two new password hashing algorithms (pbkdf2-sha256 and pbkdf2-"
"sha512). New realms will use the pbkdf2-sha256 hashing algorithm with 27500 "
"hashing iterations. Since pbkdf2-sha256 is slightly faster than pbkdf2 the "
"iterations was increased to 27500 from 20000."

"Existing realms are upgraded if the password policy contains the default "
"value for the hashing algorithm (not specified) and iteration (20000). If "
"you have changed the hashing iterations, you need to manually change to "
"pbkdf2-sha256 if you'd like to use the more secure hashing algorithm."
