msgid "Otherwise, characters are limited to those contained in database encoding which is often 8-bit. However, for some database systems, it is possible to enable UTF-8 encoding of Unicode characters and use full Unicode character set in all text fields. Often, this is counterbalanced by shorter maximum length of the strings than in case of 8-bit encodings."

msgid "Some of the databases require special settings to database and/or JDBC driver to be able to handle Unicode characters.  Please find the settings for your database below. Note that if a database is listed here, it can still work properly provided it handles UTF-8 encoding properly both on the level of database and JDBC driver."

msgid "Technically, the key criterion for Unicode support for all fields is whether the database allows setting of Unicode character set for `VARCHAR` and `CHAR` fields. If yes, there is a high chance that Unicode will be plausible, usually at the expense of field length. If it only supports Unicode in `NVARCHAR` and `NCHAR` fields, Unicode support for all text fields is unlikely as Keycloak schema uses `VARCHAR` and `CHAR` fields extensively."

msgid "If the database character set is not Unicode, then to use Unicode characters in the special fields, the JDBC driver needs to be configured with the connection property `oracle.jdbc.defaultNChar` set to `true`. It might be wise, though not strictly necessary, to also set the `oracle.jdbc.convertNcharLiterals` connection property to `true`. These properties can be set either as system properties or as connection properties. Please note that setting `oracle.jdbc.defaultNChar` may have negative impact on performance. For details, please refer to Oracle JDBC driver configuration documentation."

Please note that `utf8mb4` character set does not work due to different storage requirements to `utf8` character set footnote:[Tracked as https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-3873]).
