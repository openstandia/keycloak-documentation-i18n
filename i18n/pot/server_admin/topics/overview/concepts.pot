"Users are entities that are able to log into your system.  They can have "

msgid "roles"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Roles identify a type or category of user.  `Admin`, `user`, `manager`, and "
"`employee` are all typical roles that may exist in an organization.  "
"Applications often assign access and permissions to specific roles rather "

msgid "user role mapping"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"A user role mapping defines a mapping between a role and a user.  A user can "
"be associated with zero or more roles.  This role mapping information can be "
"encapsulated into tokens and assertions so that applications can decide "
"access permissions on various resources they manage."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"A composite role is a role that can be associated with other roles.  For "
"example a `superuser` composite role could be associated with the `sales-"
"admin` and `order-entry-admin` roles.  If a user is mapped to the "
"`superuser` role they also inherit the `sales-admin` and `order-entry-admin` "
"roles."

"Clients are entities that can request {project_name} to authenticate a "

"Consent is when you as an admin want a user to give permission to a client "
