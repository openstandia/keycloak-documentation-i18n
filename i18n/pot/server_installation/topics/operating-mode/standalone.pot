"Standalone operating mode is only useful when you want to run one, and only "
"one {project_name} server instance.  It is not usable for clustered "
"deployments and all caches are non-distributed and local-only.  It is not "
"recommended that you use standalone mode in production as you will have a "
"single point of failure.  If your standalone mode server goes down, users "
"will not be able to log in.  This mode is really only useful to test drive "
"and play with the features of {project_name}"
