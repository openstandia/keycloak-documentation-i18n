"Keycloak SAML SP Client Adapter now requires a specific endpoint, `/saml` to "
"be registered with your IdP.  The SamlFilter must also be bound to /saml in "
"addition to any other binding it has.  This had to be done because SAML POST "
"binding would eat the request input stream and this would be really bad for "
"clients that relied on it."
