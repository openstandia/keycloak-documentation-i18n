"The `master` realm in {project_name} is a special realm and treated "
"differently than other realms.  Users in the {project_name} `master` realm "
"can be granted permission to manage zero or more realms that are deployed on "
"the {project_name} server.  When a realm is created, {project_name} "
"automatically creates various roles that grant fine-grain permissions to "
"access that new realm.  Access to The Admin Console and Admin REST endpoints "
"can be controlled by mapping these roles to users in the `master` realm.  "
"It's possible to create multiple super users, as well as users that can only "
"manage specific realms."
