msgid "This document describes the Keycloak SAML client adapter and how it can be configured for a variety of platforms.  The Keycloak SAML client adapter is a standalone component that provides generic SAML 2.0 support for your web applications.  There are no Keycloak server extensions built into it.  As long as the Identity Provider (IdP) being communicated with supports standard SAML, the Keycloak SAML client adapter should be able to integrate with it."
