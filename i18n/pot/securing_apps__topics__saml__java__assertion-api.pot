"After a successful SAML login, your application code may want to obtain "
"attribute values passed with the SAML assertion.  `HttpServletRequest."
"getUserPrincipal()` returns a `Principal` object that you can typecast into "
"a {project_name} specific class called `org.keycloak.adapters.saml."
"SamlPrincipal`.  This object allows you to look at the raw assertion and "
"also has convenience functions to look up attribute values."
