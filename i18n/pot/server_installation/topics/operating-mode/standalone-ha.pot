"Standalone clustered operation mode is for when you want to run "
"{project_name} within a cluster.  This mode requires that you have a copy of "
"the {project_name} distribution on each machine you want to run a server "
"instance.  This mode can be very easy to deploy initially, but can become "
"quite cumbersome. To make a configuration change you'll have to modify each "
"distribution on each machine.  For a large cluster this can become time "
"consuming and error prone."

"The distribution has a mostly pre-configured app server configuration file "
"for running within a cluster.  It has all the specific infrastructure "
"settings for networking, databases, caches, and discovery.  This file "
"resides in _.../standalone/configuration/standalone-ha.xml_.  There's a few "
"things missing from this configuration.  You can't run {project_name} in a "
"cluster without a configuring a shared database connection.  You also need "
"to deploy some type of load balancer in front of the cluster.  The "
"<<_clustering,clustering>> and <<_database,database>> sections of this guide "
"walk you though these things."
