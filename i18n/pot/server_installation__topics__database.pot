"{project_name} comes with its own embedded Java-based relational database called H2.\n"
"This is the default database that {project_name} will use to persist data and really only exists so that you can run the authentication\n"
"server out of the box.  We highly recommend that you replace it with a more production ready external database.  The H2 database\n"
"is not very viable in high concurrency situations and should not be used in a cluster either.  The purpose of this chapter is to\n"
"show you how to connect {project_name} to a more mature database.\n"

"{project_name} uses two layered technologies to persist its relational data.  The bottom layered technology is JDBC.  JDBC\n"
"is a Java API that is used to connect to a RDBMS.  There are different JDBC drivers per database type that are provided\n"
"by your database vendor.  This chapter discusses how to configure {project_name} to use one of these vendor-specific drivers.\n"
