"To illustrate the basics of implementing the User Storage SPI let's walk "

"simple `UserStorageProvider` that looks up users in a simple property file. "
"The property file contains username and password definitions and is "
"hardcoded to a specific location on the classpath. The provider will be able "
"to look up the user by ID and username and also be able to validate "
"passwords. Users that originate from this provider will be read-only."
