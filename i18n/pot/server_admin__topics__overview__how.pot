"{project_name} is a separate server that you manage on your network.  "
"Applications are configured to point to and be secured by this server.  "
"{project_name} uses open protocol standards like link:http://openid.net/"
"connect/[Open ID Connect] or link:http://saml.xml.org/saml-"
"specifications[SAML 2.0] to secure your applications.  Browser applications "
"redirect a user's browser from the application to the {project_name} "
"authentication server where they enter their credentials.  This is important "
"because users are completely isolated from applications and applications "
"never see a user's credentials.  Applications instead are given an identity "
"token or assertion that is cryptographically signed.  These tokens can have "
"identity information like username, address, email, and other profile data.  "
"They can also hold permission data so that applications can make "
"authorization decisions.  These tokens can also be used to make secure "
"invocations on REST-based services."
