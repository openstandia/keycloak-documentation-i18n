msgid "RoleMappingsProvider SPI for the SAML adapters"
msgstr ""

msgid "We have added a new SPI that allows for the configuration of custom role mappers that are used by the SAML adapters to map the roles extracted from the SAML assertion into roles that exist in the SP application environment. This is particularly useful when the adapters need to communicate with third party IDPs and the roles set by the IDP in the assertion do not correspond to the roles that were defined for the SP application. The provider to be used can configured in the `keycloak-saml.xml` file or in the `keycloak-saml` subsystem. An implementation that performs the role mappings based on the contents of a properties file was also provided."
msgstr ""

msgid "Notice that when {project_name} acts as the IDP we can use the built-in role mappers to perform any necessary mappings before setting the roles into the assertion, so this SPI will probably be redundant in this case. The `RoleMappingsProvider` SPI was designed for situations when the IDP offer no way to map roles before adding them to the assertion."

msgid "Support for password-less authentication, multi-factor authentication and multiple credentials per user"
msgstr ""

msgid "With the arrival of W3C Web Authentication support, we've refined the authentication flow system to be able to allow a user to select which authentication method is preferred for login (for example, the choice between an OTP credential and a WebAuthn credential). The new mechanisms also allow an administrator to craft flows for password-less login, for example just using WebAuthn as an authentication method. Please note that with these changes, any custom authentication flow you have created may need to be adapted to the new flow logic."

msgid "As a result of these changes, users can now have multiple OTP devices and multiple WebAuthn devices. The same system that allows a user to select which type of device to use during login also allows that user to select which specific device to use.

msgid "The hostname SPI introduces a more flexible way to configure the hostname for {project_name}. There are two built-in providers. The first is request, which uses the request headers to determine the hostname. The second is fixed, which allows configuring a fixed hostname.

msgstr ""

msgid "For this release, we improved policy evaluation performance across the board, increasing reliability and throughput. The main changes we did were related with trying to optimize the policy evaluation path by avoiding unnecessary flows and collect decisions as soon as they happen. We also introduced a policy decision cache on a per request basis, avoiding redundant decisions from policies previously evaluated."

msgstr ""

msgid "Choosing the response mode when obtaining permissions from the server"
msgstr ""

msgid "In previous versions, permissions were always returned from the server using standard OAuth2 response, containing the access and refresh tokens. In this release, clients can use a `response_mode` parameter to specify how the server should respond to an authorization request. This parameter accepts two values:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`decision`"

msgstr ""

msgid "Most HTML output is already escaped for HTML tags, but there are some places where HTML tags are permitted. These are only where admin access is needed to update the value.

msgid "There are changes related to Client Scopes to the consent screen. The list on the consent screen is now linked to client scopes instead of protocol mappers and roles."
msgstr ""

msgid "See the documentation and migration guide for more details."

msgid "OAuth 2 Certificate Bound Access Tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid "We now have a partial implementation of the specification https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-08[OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate Bound Access Tokens] . More accurately we have support for the Certificate Bound Access Tokens. If your confidential client is able to use 2-way SSL, {project_name} will be able to add the hash of the client certificate into the tokens issued for the client. At this moment, it's just  the {project_name} itself, which verifies the token hashes (for example during `refresh token` requests). We plan to add support to adapters as well. We also plan to add support for Mutual TLS Client Authentication."

msgid "Now end-users are able to manage their resources and the permissions associated with them through the {project_name} Account Service. From there, resource owners can now check their resources, share resources with another users as well approve requests from other users."
msgstr ""

msgid "Asynchronous Authorization Flow"
msgstr ""

msgid "When using UMA, client applications can now choose whether or not an authorization request should start an authorization flow to ask for the resource owner approval. This functionality allows applications to ask for resource owner approval when trying to access one of his resources on behalf of another user."
msgstr ""

msgid "User-Managed Permission API"
msgstr ""

msgid "Resource servers are now capable of associating additional policies to resources owned by a particular user. The new API provides operations to manage these permissions using different policy types such as role, group, user, client or a condition using JavaScript."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pushed Claims"
msgstr ""

msgid "Clients applications are now able to send arbitrary claims to {project_name} along with an authorization request in order to evaluate permissions based on these claims. This is a very handy addition when access should be granted (or denied) in the scope of a specific transaction or based on information about the runtime."
msgstr ""

msgid "Resource Attributes"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is now possible to associated attributes with resources protected by {project_name} and use these same attributes to evaluate permissions from your policies."
msgstr ""

msgid "Policy enforcer now accepts regular access tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid "In some situations, you may want to just send regular access tokens to a resource server but still be able to enforce policies on these resources."
msgstr ""

msgid "One of the main changes introduced by this release is that you are no longer required to exchange access tokens with RPTs in order to access resources protected by a resource server (when not using UMA). Depending on how the policy enforcer is configured on the resource server side, you can just send regular access tokens as a bearer token and permissions will still be enforced."
msgstr ""

msgid "Policy enforcer can now load resources from the server on-demand"
msgstr ""

msgid "Until now, when deploying an application configured with a `policy-enforcer`, the policy enforcer would either load all protected paths from the server or just map these paths from the adapter configuration. Users can now decide to load paths on-demand from the server and avoid map these resources in the adapter configuration. Depending on how many protected resources you have this functionality can also improve the time to deploy an application."
msgstr ""

msgid "Policy enforcer now supports configuring the resource cache"
msgstr ""

msgid "In order to avoid unnecessary hits to the server, the policy enforcer caches the mapping between protected resources and their corresponding paths in your application. Users can now configure the behaviour of the cache or even completely disable it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Claim Information Points"
msgstr ""

msgid "The `policy-enforcer` definition on the adapters (`keycloak.json`) was also updated to support the concept of pushed claims. There you have the concept of a `claim-information-point` which can be set to push claims from different sources such as the HTTP request or even from an external HTTP service."
msgstr ""

msgid "Improvements to the Evaluation API"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Evaluation API used to implement policies in {project_name}, especially JavaScript and Drools policies, provides now methods to:"

msgid "It is now possible to define attributes on resources in order to have them used by policies when evaluating permissions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Themes and Theme Resources"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is now possible to hot-deploy themes to Keycloak through a regular provider deployment. We have also added support for theme resources, which allows adding additional templates and resources without creating a theme. This is useful for custom authenticators that require additional pages to be added to the authentication flow."
msgstr ""

msgid "We have also added support to override the theme for specific clients. If that is not adequate for your needs, then there is also a new Theme Selector SPI that allows you to implement custom logic to select the theme."
