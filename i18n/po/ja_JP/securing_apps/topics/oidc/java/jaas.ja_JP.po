However, some applications and systems may still rely on pure legacy JAAS solution.  {project_name} provides two login modules to help in these situations."

#. type: Plain text
msgid "This login module allows to authenticate with username/password from {project_name}.  It's using <<_resource_owner_password_credentials_flow,Resource Owner Password Credentials>> flow to validate if the provided username/password is valid. It's useful for non-web based systems, which need to rely on JAAS and want to use {project_name}, but can't use the standard browser based flows due to their non-web nature. Example of such application could be messaging or SSH."
