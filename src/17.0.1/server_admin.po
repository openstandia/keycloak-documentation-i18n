msgid "Supports any platform/language that has an OpenID Connect Relying Party library or SAML 2.0 Service Provider library."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic {project_name} operations"
msgstr ""

msgid "{project_name} is a separate server that you manage on your network.  Applications are configured to point to and be secured by this server.  {project_name} uses open protocol standards like link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] or link:http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications[SAML 2.0] to secure your applications.  Browser applications redirect a user's browser from the application to the {project_name} authentication server where they enter their credentials.  This redirection is important because users are completely isolated from applications and applications never see a user's credentials.  Applications instead are given an identity token or assertion that is cryptographically signed.  These tokens can have identity information like username, address, email, and other profile data.  They can also hold permission data so that applications can make authorization decisions.  These tokens can also be used to make secure invocations on REST-based services."
msgstr ""

msgid "Core concepts and terms"
msgstr ""

msgid "Consider these core concepts and terms before attempting to use {project_name} to secure your web applications and REST services."
msgstr ""

msgid "users"
msgstr ""

msgid "Users are entities that are able to log into your system.  They can have attributes associated with themselves like email, username, address, phone number, and birth day.  They can be assigned group membership and have specific roles assigned to them."
msgstr ""

msgid "authentication"
msgstr ""

msgid "The process of identifying and validating a user."
msgstr ""

msgid "authorization"
msgstr ""

msgid "The process of granting access to a user."
msgstr ""

msgid "credentials"
msgstr ""

msgid "Credentials are pieces of data that {project_name} uses to verify the identity of a user.  Some examples are passwords, one-time-passwords, digital certificates, or even fingerprints."
msgstr ""

msgid "roles"
msgstr ""

msgid "Roles identify a type or category of user.  `Admin`, `user`, `manager`, and `employee` are all typical roles that may exist in an organization.  Applications often assign access and permissions to specific roles rather than individual users as dealing with users can be too fine grained and hard to manage."
msgstr ""

msgid "user role mapping"
msgstr ""

msgid "A user role mapping defines a mapping between a role and a user.  A user can be associated with zero or more roles.  This role mapping information can be encapsulated into tokens and assertions so that applications can decide access permissions on various resources they manage."
msgstr ""

msgid "composite roles"
msgstr ""

msgid "A composite role is a role that can be associated with other roles.  For example a `superuser` composite role could be associated with the `sales-admin` and `order-entry-admin` roles.  If a user is mapped to the `superuser` role they also inherit the `sales-admin` and `order-entry-admin` roles."
msgstr ""

msgid "groups"
msgstr ""

msgid "Groups manage groups of users.  Attributes can be defined for a group.  You can map roles to a group as well.  Users that become members of a group inherit the attributes and role mappings that group defines."
msgstr ""

msgid "realms"
msgstr ""

msgid "A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.  A user belongs to and logs into a realm.  Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control."
msgstr ""

msgid "clients"
msgstr ""

msgid "Clients are entities that can request {project_name} to authenticate a user.  Most often, clients are applications and services that want to use {project_name} to secure themselves and provide a single sign-on solution.  Clients can also be entities that just want to request identity information or an access token so that they can securely invoke other services on the network that are secured by {project_name}."
msgstr ""

msgid "client adapters"
msgstr ""

msgid "Client adapters are plugins that you install into your application environment to be able to communicate and be secured by {project_name}.  {project_name} has a number of adapters for different platforms that you can download.  There are also third-party adapters you can get for environments that we don't cover."
msgstr ""

msgid "consent"
msgstr ""

msgid "Consent is when you as an admin want a user to give permission to a client before that client can participate in the authentication process. After a user provides their credentials, {project_name} will pop up a screen identifying the client requesting a login and what identity information is requested of the user.  User can decide whether or not to grant the request."
msgstr ""

msgid "client scopes"
msgstr ""

msgid "When a client is registered, you must define protocol mappers and role scope mappings for that client. It is often useful to store a client scope, to make creating new clients easier by sharing some common settings. This is also useful for requesting some claims or roles to be conditionally based on the value of `scope` parameter. {project_name} provides the concept of a client scope for this."
msgstr ""

msgid "client role"
msgstr ""

msgid "Clients can define roles that are specific to them.  This is basically a role namespace dedicated to the client."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "access token"
msgstr ""

msgid "A token that can be provided as part of an HTTP request that grants access to the service being invoked on.  This is part of the OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 specification."
msgstr ""

msgid "assertion"
msgstr ""

msgid "Information about a user.  This usually pertains to an XML blob that is included in a SAML authentication response that provided identity metadata about an authenticated user."
msgstr ""

msgid "service account"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each client has a built-in service account which allows it to obtain an access token."
msgstr ""

msgid "direct grant"
msgstr ""

msgid "A way for a client to obtain an access token on behalf of a user via a REST invocation."
msgstr ""

msgid "protocol mappers"
msgstr ""

msgid "For each client you can tailor what claims and assertions are stored in the OIDC token or SAML assertion.  You do this per client by creating and configuring protocol mappers."
msgstr ""

msgid "session"
msgstr ""

msgid "When a user logs in, a session is created to manage the login session.  A session contains information like when the user logged in and what applications have participated within single-sign on during that session.  Both admins and users can view session information."
msgstr ""

msgid "user federation provider"
msgstr ""

msgid "{project_name} can store and manage users.  Often, companies already have LDAP or Active Directory services that store user and credential information.  You can point {project_name} to validate credentials from those external stores and pull in identity information."
msgstr ""

msgid "identity provider"
msgstr ""

msgid "An identity provider (IDP) is a service that can authenticate a user.  {project_name} is an IDP."
msgstr ""

msgid "identity provider federation"
msgstr ""

msgid "{project_name} can be configured to delegate authentication to one or more IDPs.  Social login via Facebook or Google+ is an example of identity provider federation.  You can also hook {project_name} to delegate authentication to any other OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 IDP."
msgstr ""

msgid "identity provider mappers"
msgstr ""

msgid "When doing IDP federation you can map incoming tokens and assertions to user and session attributes.  This helps you propagate identity information from the external IDP to your client requesting authentication."
msgstr ""

msgid "required actions"
msgstr ""

msgid "Required actions are actions a user must perform during the authentication process.  A user will not be able to complete the authentication process until these actions are complete.  For example, an admin may schedule users to reset their passwords every month.  An `update password` required action would be set for all these users."
msgstr ""

msgid "authentication flows"
msgstr ""

msgid "Authentication flows are work flows a user must perform when interacting with certain aspects of the system.  A login flow can define what credential types are required.  A registration flow defines what profile information a user must enter and whether something like reCAPTCHA must be used to filter out bots.  Credential reset flow defines what actions a user must do before they can reset their password."
msgstr ""

msgid "events"
msgstr ""

msgid "Events are audit streams that admins can view and hook into."
msgstr ""

msgid "themes"

msgstr ""

msgid "When you register new users in {project_name} and `Sync Registrations` is ON for the LDAP provider, the fullName mapper permits falling back to the username. This fallback is  useful when using Microsoft Active Directory (MSAD). The common setup for MSAD is to configure the `cn` LDAP attribute as fullName and, at the same time, use the `cn` LDAP attribute as the `RDN LDAP Attribute` in the LDAP provider configuration. With this setup, {project_name} falls back to the username. For example, if you create {project_name} user \"john123\" and leave firstName and lastName empty, then the fullname mapper saves \"john123\" as the value of the `cn` in LDAP. When you enter \"John Doe\" for firstName and lastName later, the fullname mapper updates LDAP `cn` to the \"John Doe\" value as falling back to the username is unnecessary."

This behavior is _identity federation_. If the user already exists, {project_name} may ask the user to link the identity returned from the identity provider with the existing account. This behavior is _account linking_. With {project_name}, you can configure _Account linking_ and specify it in the <<_identity_broker_first_login,First Login Flow>>. At this step, {project_name} authenticates the user and issues its token to access the requested resource in the service provider."
msgstr ""

msgid "When the user authenticates, {project_name} redirects the user to the service provider by sending the token previously issued during the local authentication."
msgstr ""

msgid "The service provider receives the token from {project_name} and permits access to the protected resource."
msgstr ""

msgid "Variations of this flow are possible. For example, the client application can request a specific identity provider rather than displaying a list of them, or you can set {project_name} to force users to provide additional information before federating their identity."
msgstr ""

msgid "At the end of the authentication process, {project_name} issues its token to client applications. Client applications are separate from the external identity providers, so they cannot see the client application's protocol or how they validate the user's identity. The provider only needs to know about {project_name}."

msgid "{project_name} includes several actions to prevent malicious actors from stealing access tokens and refresh tokens. The crucial action is to enforce SSL/HTTPS communication between {project_name} and its clients and applications. {project_name} does not enable SSL by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another action to mitigate damage from leaked access tokens is to shorten the token's lifespans. You can specify token lifespans within the <<_timeouts, timeouts page>>. Short lifespans for access tokens force clients and applications to refresh their access tokens after a short time. If an admin detects a leak, the admin can log out all user sessions to invalidate these refresh tokens or set up a revocation policy."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ensure refresh tokens always stay private to the client and are never transmitted."

msgid "You can mitigate damage from leaked access tokens and refresh tokens by issuing these tokens as holder-of-key tokens. See <<_mtls-client-certificate-bound-tokens, OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Certificate Bound Access Token>> for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "If an access token or refresh token is compromised, access the Admin Console and push a not-before revocation policy to all applications. Pushing a not-before policy ensures that any tokens issued before that time become invalid.

msgid "Limit Authentication Sessions"
msgstr ""

msgid "When a login page is opened for the first time in a web browser, {project_name} creates an object called authentication session that stores some useful information about the request. Whenever a new login page is opened from a different tab in the same browser, {project_name} creates a new record called authentication sub-session that is stored within the authentication session. Authentication requests can come from any type of clients such as the Admin CLI. In that case, a new authentication session is also created with one authentication sub-session. Please note that authentication sessions can be created also in other ways than using a browser flow. The text below is applicable regardless of the source flow."
msgstr ""

msgid "This section describes deployments that use the {jdgserver_name} provider for authentication sessions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Authentication session is internally stored as `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity`. Each `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity` can have multiple authentication sub-sessions stored within the `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity` as a collection of `AuthenticationSessionEntity` objects. {project_name} stores authentication sessions in a dedicated {jdgserver_name} cache. The number of `AuthenticationSessionEntity` per `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity` contributes to the size of each cache entry. Total memory footprint of authentication session cache is determined by the number of stored `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity` and by the number of `AuthenticationSessionEntity` within each `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of maintained `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity` objects corresponds to the number of unfinished login flows from the browser. To keep the number of `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity` under control, using an advanced firewall control to limit ingress network traffic is recommended."
msgstr ""

msgid "Higher memory usage may occur for deployments where there are many active `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity` with a lot of `AuthenticationSessionEntity`. If the load balancer does not support or is not configured for link:{installguide_stickysessions_link}[session stickiness], the load over network in a cluster can increase significantly. The reason for this load is that each request that lands on a node that does not own the appropriate authentication session needs to retrieve and update the authentication session record in the owner node which involves a separate network transmission for both the retrieval and the storage."
msgstr ""

msgid "The maximum number of `AuthenticationSessionEntity` per `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity` can be configured in `authenticationSessions` SPI by setting property `authSessionsLimit`. The default value is set to 300 `AuthenticationSessionEntity` per a `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity`.
