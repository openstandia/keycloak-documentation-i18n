"Resource servers (applications or services serving protected resources) "

"information is usually obtained from a security token, usually sent as a "
"bearer token on every request to the server. For web applications that rely "
"on a session to authenticate users, that information is usually stored in a "
"user's session and retrieved from there for each request."

"Frequently, resource servers only perform authorization decisions based on "
