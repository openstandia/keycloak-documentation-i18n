"This should be set to __true__ if your application serves both a web "
"application and web services (e.g. SOAP or REST).  It allows you to redirect "
"unauthenticated users of the web application to the Keycloak login page, but "
"send an HTTP `401` status code to unauthenticated SOAP or REST clients "
"instead as they would not understand a redirect to the login page.  Keycloak "
"auto-detects SOAP or REST clients based on typical headers like `X-Requested-"
"With`, `SOAPAction` or `Accept`.  The default value is _false_."
