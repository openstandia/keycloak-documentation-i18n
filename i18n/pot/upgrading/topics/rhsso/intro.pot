"Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) 7.1 is based on the Keycloak project and "
"provides security for your web applications by providing Web single sign-on "
"capabilities based on popular standards such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, "
"and OAuth 2.0.  The Red Hat Single Sign-On Server can act as a SAML or "
"OpenID Connect-based identity provider, mediating with your enterprise user "
"directory or third-party SSO provider for identity information and your "
"applications using standards-based tokens."

"RH-SSO provides two operating modes: standalone server or managed domain. "
"The standalone server operating mode represents running RH-SSO as a single "
"server instance. The managed domain operating mode allows for the management "
"of multiple RH-SSO instances from a single control point. The upgrade "
"process differs depending on which operating mode has been implemented. "
"Specific instructions for each mode are provided where applicable."

"A major upgrade or migration is required when RH-SSO is upgraded from one "
"major release to another, for example, from Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.0 to "
"Red Hat Single Sign-On 8.0. There may be breaking API changes between major "
"releases that could require rewriting parts of applications or server "
"extensions."

"Red Hat Single Sign-On periodically provides point releases, which are minor "
"updates that include bug fixes, security fixes, and new features. If you "
"plan to upgrade from one Red Hat Single Sign-On point release to another, "
"for example, from Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.0 to Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1, "
"code changes should not be required for applications or custom server "
"extensions as long as no private, unsupported, or tech preview APIs are used."

"Red Hat Single Sign-On 7 also periodically provides micro releases that "
"contain bug and security fixes.  Micro releases increment the minor release "
"version by the last digit, for example from 7.1.0 to 7.1.1. These release do "
"not require migration and should not impact the server configuration files. "
"The patch management system for ZIP installations can also rollback the "
"patch and server configuration."

"A micro release only contains the artifacts that have changed. For example "
"if Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1.1 contains changes to the server and the "
"JavaScript adapter, but not the EAP adapter, only the server and JavaScript "
"adapter are released and require updating."
