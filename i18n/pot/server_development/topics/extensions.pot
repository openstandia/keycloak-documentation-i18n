"The methods `getChangelogLocation` and `getFactoryId` are important to "

"liquibase.org/[Liquibase] is a framework for updating the database schema, "
"which {project_name} internally uses to create the DB schema and update the "
"DB schema among versions. You may need to use it as well and create a "
"changelog for your entities. Note that versioning of your own Liquibase "
"changelog is independent of {project_name} versions. In other words, when "
"you update to a new {project_name} version, you are not forced to update "
"your schema at the same time. And vice versa, you can update your schema "
"even without updating the {project_name} version. The Liquibase update is "
"always done at the server startup, so to trigger a DB update of your schema, "
"you just need to add the new changeset to your Liquibase changelog file (in "
"the example above it's the file `META-INF/example-changelog.xml` which must "
"be packed in same JAR as the JPA entities and `ExampleJpaEntityProvider`) "
"and then restart server.  The DB schema will be automatically updated at "
"startup."
