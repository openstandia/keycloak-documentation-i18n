"link:http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications[SAML 2.0] is a similar specification to OIDC but a lot older and more mature.  It has its roots in SOAP and the plethora\n"
"of WS-* specifications so it tends to be a bit more verbose than OIDC.  SAML 2.0 is primarily an authentication protocol\n"
"that works by exchanging XML documents between the authentication server and the application.  XML signatures and encryption\n"
"is used to verify requests and responses.\n"

"There is really two types of use cases when using SAML.  The first is an application that asks the {project_name} server to authenticate\n"
"a user for them.  After a successful login, the application will receive an XML document that contains\n"
"something called a SAML assertion that specify various attributes about the user.  This XML document is digitally signed by\n"
"the realm and contains access information (like user role mappings) that the application can use to determine what resources the user\n"
"is allowed to access on the application.\n"

"The second type of use cases is that of a client that wants to gain access to remote services.  In this case, the client asks {project_name}\n"
"to obtain an SAML assertion it can use to invoke on other remote services on behalf of the user.\n"
