"Authentciation] is an OIDC-Like protocol used to authenticate users against "
"a Docker registry.  {project_name}'s implementation of this protocol allows "
"for a {project_name} authentication server to be used by a Docker client to "
"authenticate against a registry.  While this protocol uses fairly standard "
"token and signature mechanisms, it has a few wrinkles that prevent it from "
"being treated as a true OIDC implementation.  The largest deviations include "
"a very specific JSON format for requests and responses as well as the "
"ability to understand how to map repository names and permissions to the "
"OAuth scope mechanism."
