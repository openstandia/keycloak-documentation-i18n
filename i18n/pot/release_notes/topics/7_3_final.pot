msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Authorization Services has been upgraded to be based on the new User Managed "
"Access 2.0 (UMA 2.0) specification. Previous releases relied on the UMA 1.0 "

"resources, associated permissions, approve requests to access and share them "

"Improvements to the Evaluation API - Access information from the current "

#. type: Plain text

"Asynchronous authorization flow - Client applications can now choose whether "

"on behalf of another user."

"User-managed Permission API - Resource servers are now capable of "
"associating additional policies to resources owned by a particular user. The "
"new API provides operations to manage these permissions using different "
"policy types such as role, group, user, client, or a condition using "
"JavaScript."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Pushed claims - Client applications are now able to send arbitrary claims to "
"Keycloak along with an authorization request in order to evaluate "
"permissions based on these claims. This is a very handy addition when access "
"should be granted (or denied) in the scope of a specific transaction or "
"based on information about the runtime."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Policy enforcer - The policy enforcer now accepts regular access tokens, "
"longer requiring to exchange access tokens with RPTs in order to access "
"resources protected by a resource server (when not using UMA). Depending on "
"how the policy enforcer is configured on the resource server side, regular "
"access tokens as a bearer token can be leveraged."
